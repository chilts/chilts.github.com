Firstly, I'd like to thank JD for linking to my site. It's an awesome thing to be able to say I got a link off <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/11/27/personal-finance-sites-from-around-the-world-2008-edition/">GetRichSlowly</a> in my first three months on this journey of mine towards financial independence and early retirement.

<blockquote>Retire at 40 â€” This personal-finance blog from Andrew Chilton is based in New Zealand, and features some excellent discussions of topics like budgeting, lifestyle inflation, and financial independence.</blockquote>
