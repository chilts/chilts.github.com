<p>My post over at Lazy's blog was originally called <strong>Short Term Sacrifices for Long Term Gain</strong> but in conjunction with Lazy we changed it to <a href="http://www.lazymanandmoney.com/sacrificing-the-little-things-for-early-retirement/">Sacrificing the Little Things for Early Retirement</a> so his readers could get more of a taste of my background, why I started all this and where I'm headed.</p>
<p>I wrote the post in response to a comment I had on a previous blog post of mine, called <a href="http://www.retire-at-40.com/blog/seeing-the-old-me.html#comments">Seeing the Old Me</a>. <strong>Concetta</strong> put the idea in my head when she commented that by doing a four day work week, I <em>was actually treating myself, all the time</em>! I hadn't realised this at the time (though it makes perfect sense now).</p>
<p>I'd mentioned that I had been buying take-away coffees and treats for myself in reward for working too hard which brought back memories of the old me again. Working hard, playing hard but spending all of my money whilst doing it. Then I mentioned that I had to sacrifice things if I wanted to do a four day work week (oh, and retire early, mustn't forget that) - and by not spending my money on those '<em>extras</em>' I could also afford to drop down a day at work. It turns out though that she was right and that having the extra day off is a <em>huge</em> treat, week in, week out.</p>
<p>If other people think that by not going to the movies that often or not having the flashiest car is a sacrifice, then that's fine with me. Neither of these things are that important to me and instead I'll make some fresh pasta, go out cycling or enjoy a bit of gardening instead. Better health and less outgoings.</p>
<p>Therefore a few small sacrifices gets me a much bigger reward - as always, judgement is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>And funnily enough, these are also the same people who say &quot;<em>...and you can afford that?</em>&quot; when they hear you're working a 4 day week. Pretty funny, isn't it?</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
