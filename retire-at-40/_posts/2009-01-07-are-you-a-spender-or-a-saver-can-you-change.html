<p>Jonathan at Master your Card wrote a guest entry over at Four Pillars. It was titled <a href="http://www.four-pillars.ca/2008/12/17/how-to-change-your-financial-personality/">How to Change Your Financial Personality</a>. I found it an intriguing article and got me thinking.</p>
<p>Here's part of the comment I left over there:</p>
<blockquote>I used to be a spender (with a few savings) but now I’m a saver (with a few spendings). I think you’re right, we do flit and flirt between them but I now know I’m on the right track and probably won’t ever become a 'spender' again.</blockquote>

<p>As I've mentioned before, since September last year many things about my life has changed and pretty much all of those have been for the better. I really don't spend as much as I used to which has afforded me the freedom to work a four day week and spend more time doing the things I enjoy.</p>
<h2>My Changes</h2>
<p>Therefore change for me was actually surprisingly easy. Of course, my change was enforced since I wouldn't have been able to sustain my previous <em>spender</em> lifestyle and be able to only work four days.</p>
<p>I bumped into an ex-boss the other day and we got chatting how things were. I told him that I was working a four day week and he immediately asked: &quot;<em>And you can afford that?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>I replied: &quot;<em>Well, you make yourself afford it.</em>&quot; I'm not sure whether he actually liked the answer since I'm sure there are many people who would say that they couldn't but the truth of the matter is, many people can, if they only <a href="turning-lifestyle-inflation-into.html">curb their lifestyle slightly</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to make this a long blog entry since Johnathan wrote a great article. Also because there are a few other things I want to touch on before I go. However, one thing that stuck in my head about all this is whether each of us has the ability to change.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Can you change? Let me know whether you have, you can or you will.</em></p>
<h2>Changes in the 'Andy @ Retire at 40' World</h2>
<p>As you can see, I have a brand new blog with my own domain now. It is all very exciting and I even managed to migrate all my old entries and comments over to the new one.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot to ask but if you have a link to <a href="/">Retire at 40</a> in your blogroll, can you please update the link so that any of your readers coming here won't have to go through BlogSpot to be redirected. Many, many thanks to each of you, I owe you one big time.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you good people who have already subscribed to the blog will automatically come here from now on since my feed now points to the right place. You're also in luck since there are quite a few interesting features planned for this site over the next few months so if you're not already subscribed, do so now so you don't miss out (that big orange RSS icon in the corner is what you're after).</p>
<p>By the way, thank you to everyone who has subscribed to 'Retire at 40' recently. I thought getting to 100 subscribers by month 3 was pretty exciting but I seem to have gained about another 50 in the past month (pending what happens with the blog move). Welcome to all of you.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to contact me (address at bottom) to say hi, talk about PF, point me to an article, ask me a question or just to chat about anything at all. It's great hearing from you guys.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope you all had a great Christmas and New Year and keep enjoying the blog now that I am back.
