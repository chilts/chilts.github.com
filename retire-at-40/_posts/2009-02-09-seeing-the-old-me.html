<p>Over the past few weeks, I have been working extra hard. Too hard in fact. Long hours, many days and that means I have a problem.</p>
<p>Well, I say one problem, it's more a group of problems. In fact, I seem to be getting quite a few problems that my little group of them is becoming quite a collection.</p>

<p>You see, because I've been in work too much I haven't been living my life the best way I should.</p>
<h2>Reasons for Having Problems</h2>
<p>My goal when I started this blog off in September was to work a four day week. That lasted two months until I had to work a five day week. In January I was working at least a six day if not a seven day week, and they were pretty long too.</p>
<p>This causes no end of problems.</p>
<p>The reasons for the problems however are all due to one thing. Time.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>That one little word.</p>
<p>Say it again... time.</p>
<p>It's something that I have had very little of recently. That small, four letter, very smooth, round and mellow word is the cause of many of my more recent problems (which I shall get on to shortly). Of course, it hasn't been because I have had so much of it but rather because I have had so little of it.</p>
<h2>Effects of Lack of Time</h2>
<p>Going shopping has been a pain. The fact that my local supermarket which is on my walk home from work is open until 11pm has been a great lifesaver since my 10 or 12 hours days have given me little in the way of opportunities to actually go and get food - which has mainly consisted this month of buying milk, bread and stuff to put on sandwiches. And of course, since I just had to go whenever I needed, I always <a href="are-you-throwing-away-money-5-tips-to.html">forgot to take my re-useable bags with me</a>.</p>
<p>My home life has also been a bit chaotic. I've been washing and hanging my clothes out at lunchtimes since they seemed to be the only parts of the day I could actually relax. A quick walk home, put in some washing, make some food, hang the washing out, walk back to work. It still makes it busy and I never really got chance to sit on my back deck and watch the world go by.</p>
<p>Granted, work has been buying (mostly) food each evening to keep us alive but of course, the food bought then mostly consists of take-aways which I got pretty tired of eating quite soon. Pizza is okay every now and again, but three times in a week is not good. Added to that is the fact that they aren't really that healthy for you and I'd much rather be eating something of my own creation.</p>
<p>Every so often I considered that I would be able to make something at home too (and recently have been forcing myself home for tea too) but many times I would buy something with the intention of cooking it but never getting around to it. So I even had to throw away food which is something I try not to do at all these days. So there is one way I've wasted money.</p>
<h2>The Things I Have Reverted To (and Hence Wasted Money)</h2>
<p>Occasionally I'd be leaving work at a half decent hour but of course felt too tired to cook. Hence I would end up eating out at prices which are about twice you can make two wholesome meals for at home.</p>
<p>I also even reverted to buying chocolate, coke or even coffee during those really stressful days (when I really thought that I should treat myself). Firstly, we know how much these <a href="10-little-sacrifices-which-make-big.html">little things add up over time</a> but also upon reflection they just aren't worth it. Even though I was working hard because I was asked to, I almost slipped back into the vicious cycle:</p>
<ul><li>I treated myself because I was working too hard</li><li>I was working hard because I needed the money</li><li>I needed the money because I was treating myself</li></ul>
<p>Compare this to when I was working a four day week and you can see that it is an upwards spiral:</p>
<ul><li>I could work a four day week because I wasn't treating myself</li><li>I didn't have to treat myself because I didn't feel all stressed out</li><li>I didn't feel stressed out because I was working a four day week</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, I'd rather be in the second upward cycle than the first downward one.</p>
<h2>It was Close</h2>
<p>Certainly there were times this month when I spent too much, either on food or otherwise. Also since I wasn't going out on my bike as much (a free activity), some of the other activities I was getting up to were things that cost money and were reasonably expensive. They also happened to be the most convenient. It turns out that not only did I have very few hours of spare time but January was also the most expensive month I've had in months.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense does it? But it's all perfectly explicable. To relieve the tension, the strain and the stress, I turned to the quick, easy and expensive options. My old, dark days were filtering back through the dark clouds.</p>
<p>At one stage in the month, I was even thinking to myself &quot;<em>Creepers, maybe I have to go back to a five day week just to keep up with my spending!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Which shocked me. Once I had that thought, I decided to confront the powers that be and told them that I would have to go back to a sensible and somewhat normal work week once February kicks in. I'm sure I'll be doing a 5 day work week again this month though I suspect things will be back to normal come March.</p>
<p>I just hope that the extra pay from January, the extra from February and any overtime/time off in lieu I get is all worth it in the end. We'll soon see (I hope).</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had problems falling away from the straight and narrow with your finances and had to force yourself to get back on the right tracks?</strong>
