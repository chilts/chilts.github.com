<p>There seems to be some debate in the PF world at the moment about what the terms 'Frugal' and 'Cheap' mean. I think there are some interesting points but in all honesty I really think that it is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Personally I think I prefer the term Frugal rather than Cheap due to the same reason <a href="http://community.careonecredit.com/blogs/debt_diva/archive/2009/02/19/frugal-versus-cheap.aspx">DebtDiva</a> mentions ... that cheap has negative connotations, but mostly it doesn't matter to me.</p>
<p>I have known a number of people over the years who have said things to me like &quot;<em>I'm too cheap to buy [this] or [that]</em>&quot;. They obviously don't care about any negative feelings towards being 'cheap'.</p>
<h2>To Me, It Doesn't Matter</h2>
<p>In reality, it all amounts to the same thing anyway, that these people who call themselves frugal or cheap look after their money a bit more than those who don't. Possibly by not spending as frivolously, saving well and looking at the long term needs rather than the short term wants.</p>
<h2>The One Thing I Remember</h2>
<p>There is however one phrase that I try to remember when I am purchasing something. Generally I don't go for the cheapest stuff but at the same time I don't go for the most expensive either. I've always been a middle-of-the-road guy when it comes to such things (of course, it is very dependent on what it is you're buying).</p>
<p>As it turns out, this particular phrase has stood me in good stead over the years and I somehow manage to make my purchases last years longer than what some other people would. By not buying the cheapest thing, my possessions usually last as long or longer than I need or want them to. Adhere to this phrase and you'll probably be able to do the same too:</p>
<blockquote>Only the rich can afford to buy cheap!</blockquote>
<p>It's one of those phrases I heard once and never forgot. The friend who told that was well on the way to retirement at an early age (probably mid-forties and he could stop work - not that he will) and I've thought about it all the time since.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the words 'frugal' and 'cheap'? How about 'thrifty'? Does it really matter?</strong>
