As I've <a href="budgeting.html">stated before</a>, "it seems more likely that you can become financially independent by literally <span style="font-style:italic;">spending less than you earn</span> than you can by winning the lottery".
</p>

<p>
And that is exactly how I'd like to introduce myself.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">About Me</span>
</p>

As it says in my footer: <span style="font-style:italic;">Retire-at-40 is a personal finance journey of a regular guy, with a regular job doing regular things.</span> I earn well though I've never been a saver. Then I started getting serious at the start of September 2008 and in just over a month I know my life has drastically changed.
</p>

<p>
I can see myself spending less. I can see myself saving more. I can see myself working less. And I can see myself enjoying my life more. In fact, all of these things are already happening. Why? Because they <a href="whats-your-dream.html">lead me to my goals</a> and they make me worry less.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The Long Slow Road to Financial Independence</span>
</p>

<p>
It didn't take me long to figure out that it was a long road from starting work to stopping it completely. My initial problem though was that I never did anything about it. Until now. My journey on the road to Financial Independence has well and truly started with a bang. The changes in my life are already great and I have a nice shiny new blog to boot.
</p>

<p>
You'll notice along the way that I use certain phrases over others. Take for example the phrase "<span style="font-style:italic;">The Road to Financial Independence</span>". I like it, it makes sense to me so I use it. Now consider the phrase "<span style="font-style:italic;">The Road to Wealth</span>" or "<span style="font-style:italic;">The Road to Riches</span>". I don't use these because I don't like them. They promise too much and deliver almost nothing. "<span style="font-style:italic;">The Long Slow Road to Financial Independence</span>" may seem a lot less razzmatazz (almost boring) than those other phrases but then, if you know me, you'll understand that I like to be realistic and I like to understate things. And I also like to be sensible too.
</p>

<p>
Which leads me on to another phrase "<span style="font-style:italic;">sensible spending and saving</span>". I like it. It makes me happy.
</p>

<p>
Both of these phrase describe how I'm undertaking this journey. There are no quick solutions. There is no point hanging out for a lottery win. Just a plain and simple way of life, of decluttering, of making things last, of creating things and of being sensible.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Promise less, deliver more!</span>
</p>

<p>
Even though I'm still new to this game, I've already realised that anyone can do what I'm doing. I know this because I used to spend up every month. I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck but I would usually spend what I earnt.
</p>

<p>
By promising myself that I <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> be a saver, I <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> be frugal and I <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> invest wisely, I have realised that my future looks a lot more rosy now than it did just a month ago.
</p>

<p>
I've always been sensible with my money and sometimes clever but now I'm learning even more tricks of the trade. For example, the way the Simple Dollar is creating a <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/10/05/creating-a-cd-ladder-for-your-emergency-fund-or-other-savings-to-earn-a-better-safe-return/">Savings Ladder</a> (with fixed term investments) is pretty intelligent. It's almost one of the best posts I've read since reading a number of Personal Finance blogs.
</p>

<p>
I just wish I were that clever. Except, I don't have to be. You see, I'm just a regular guy. Instead, I just inform myself of the things other people are doing and in doing so I hope that I can make <span style="font-style:italic;">my money work for me</span> rather than <span style="font-style:italic;">me having to work for my money</span>. Makes sense doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Signing Off</span>
</p>

<p>
I realise this post has been a slightly roundabout way of an introduction but I wanted to give you illustrations rather than just plain facts. Illustrations how you can also do the same as I am. Even today, I was told by a friend that they "<span style="font-style:italic;">were not that type of person</span>" to do what I shall be doing.
</p>

<p>
I just asked "<span style="font-style:italic;">Well, have you tried?</span>"
</p>

<p>
The answer was "<span style="font-style:italic;">No</span>".
</p>

<p>
All I can say to that is to take your first step on the long slow road to financial independence. I promise you, it will interesting, fulfilling, happy and hopefully rewarding.
