## Stallman, Torvalds and Knuth chatting ... ##

Richard M. Stallman, Linus Thorvalds [sic], and Donald E. Knuth engage in a discussion on whose impact on the
computerized world was the greatest.

**Stallman**: "God told me I have programmed the best editor in the world!"

**Torvalds**: "Well, God told *me* that I have programmed the best operating system in the world!"

**Knuth**: "Wait, wait - I never said that."
