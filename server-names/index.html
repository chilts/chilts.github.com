<h2>About Server Names</h2>

<p>
Ever needed a name for a new server or a lot of names for loads of new servers? Here you'll find unique names within
themes so you know instantly what that server is doing, which project owns it or which client it belongs to.
</p>

<p>
Back in 2007 I worked for Weta Digital and was amazed at how many servers they had there. Their particular naming
scheme was something like this one I present here. Only 20 names were chosen for each theme since it's hard to find
names starting with some letters (quvxyz).
</p>

<p>
Finally, 100 is also a multiple of 20 and they used to buy servers in their hundreds! This was a great scheme for
individualising every group of servers coming in and I present some names for you here.
</p>

<h2>The Naming Scheme</h2>

<p>
The naming scheme goes something like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>every set of servers has a theme (e.g. rivers)</li>
  <li>every theme has 20 names beginning with a different letter</li>
  <li>every single server name on this site is unique (I hope)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server Name Lists</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="fish.html">Fish</a></li>
</ul>
