There are a number of overlaps in the "Personal Finance":/retire-at-40/ world and the "Simple Life":/simplicity/ world. Having just read "The Other Side of the Frugality Fence":http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/12/31/the-other-side-of-the-frugality-fence/ I realised that doing this can help simplify your life too.

One particular quote Trent said jumped out at me:

bq. The solution? Cut back. Ask yourself what things you most enjoy doing and toss the rest of it. Look for ways of minimizing the costs of the things you do enjoy.

As I said in the comment I left over there:

bq. It's definitely a good idea to review what is important to you every so often. That way, you can see what your biggest enjoyments are and whether you're scrimping on them which actually makes them less enjoyable.

bq. It's also about cutting down or out all of those things which aren't that important, especially if they cost an arm and a leg :)

By letting go of some of the things that don't give you as much pleasure, you also end up saving both money and time. Both of which you can (if you choose) spend on the things that are more enjoyable to you.

Finally, happy New Year to you all, I hope 2010 gives you your best, and most simplest, year yet!
