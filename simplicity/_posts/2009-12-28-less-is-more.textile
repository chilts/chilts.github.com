In quite a number of the articles on this site, many of them give lists of good and bad things. Unlike many other parts of life, with simplicity, less is more.

"Try a Smaller Home":try-a-smaller-home.html is a perfect example of that.

In normal life, you get all of those lists which say *higher*, *greater*, *extra* and *more*. But those, they're the bad lists.

In the simple life, you want to be reading those lists that say *lower*, *lesser*, *fewer* and *less*. See them, they're the good lists.

Having less of something means less to worry about, less to clean, less to think about and less to try and remember.

h2. A Different Way of Thinking

It can take a little bit of time to figure out that this is, in fact, a better way of thinking. Usually having more money is a good thing, or being able to run faster, do more or have more but with the simple life, the opposite is true.

Once you get your head around the fact that less is more then you're well on your way to a more simple and more thoughtful life. One with more time on your hands and more time to enjoy the things that you truely enjoy.

So as you can see, _less is more_.
