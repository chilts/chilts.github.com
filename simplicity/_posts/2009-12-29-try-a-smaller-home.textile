Having a large home means you have more things to think about. Also many more things to worry about. Let's just note a few of them down:

* more space to leave things you don't use
* more space to put things you don't want
* greater expenses to fix things
* more payment of tax/rates to the government
* more garden to sort out
* more places to clean

Having a "smaller home brings many advantages":less-is-more.html. Here are just a few things but please leave a comment with any others:

* less space to hoard material things
* lower expenses for upkeep
* lower payment to the government
* less garden to upkeep
* fewer spaces to clean

Some of these are subjective (I personally like a good sized garden since I find it very enjoyable) but mostly you'd agree with them I'm sure.
