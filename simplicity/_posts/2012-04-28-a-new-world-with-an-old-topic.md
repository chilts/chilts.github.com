## Getting the Right Amount of Sleep ##

Since the last time I wrote on 'Simplicity', I have had quite a few changes in my life ... but in some ways, it doesn't
mean they are. The fact is, no matter where we are in life, what we are doing, who we are with or what we plan to do,
there is always scope for making things more simple.

And what is the latest thing I want to do, well, it's an age-old subject that I've already spoken about once on this
blog, and that is [my sleeping regime](my-new-sleeping-regime.html).

However, that post was a long time ago and many things have changed, so instead, let's look at what hasn't - and this
is where it starts to become clear - I still need to sleep every night! Ta dah, and there's the magic.

So, re-reading that post, I've realised that I got half of it right. I said that I was going to go to bed at the same time every day, and get up at the same time every day. I think the latter is much more important and that's where it wins.

I also found an older three part post regarding all of this on Steve Pavlina's site:

* [How to Become an Early Riser](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/)
* [How to Become an Early Riser - Part II](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser-part-ii/)
* [How to Get Up Right Away When Your Alarm Goes Off](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/)

So put those on your reading list and let's take it from here. :)
