<p>This weekend, KiwiWriters is challenging you to write 2,000 words in a genre you have never written in before.</p>
<p>It's the start of a series of short challenges where we will try to get you out of your comfort zone and try (at least just for a short while) something different.</p>
<p>This month, we are asking you to <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/zing-thing-jul07.html">write in a genre you have never written before</a>. Already there are people have finished and maybe some of those have already edited their story too.</p>
<p>So far, I have written 860 words and I'm really enjoying it. I'm writing a medieval love story though already it has taken a turn for the worst. I think this might be the first romance where the guy didn't get the girl. Oh, and there is blood and guts in it too. It's turning into a mixture of things really, none of which I have ever written before, so that's a good thing.</p>
<p>We will be holding these challenges every so often so there is always a challenge or two coming up.</p>
<p>Once I've finished, I'm going to firstly post the unedited version and then add the edited finished version at a later date. It'll be over in my <a href="/writing/">writing</a> section.
