<p>Over at KiwiWriters, we're aiming for a very large number of words to be written this month. Oh alright, it's not one billion, but we are going for a million!</p>
<p>Between all of the participants in the SoCNoC challenge over at <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> we've done a massive number of words. At the moment, we're on a fabulous total of <strong>949,389</strong> words, just a few short of 950 thousand words.</p>
<p>...but our aim is to get to a total of one million words!</p>
<p>It's so close it is rather scary and yet we only have two more days to do it. Also, the problem is, a number of people have already finished and therefore won't necessarily contribute any more words. Contrary to that though, there are a few other people who <em>have</em> finished and are <em>still going</em>!</p>
<p>It's amazing to think that our little group has made so many people write so many words.</p>
<p>So, we're looking for about 15 winners and I think and I shall cross the line either tomorrow night or sometime on Satuday. Currently, I stand on 47252. I'll try and get something just over that to help getting towards the one million mark :-)</p>
<p>Wish us luck.</p>
