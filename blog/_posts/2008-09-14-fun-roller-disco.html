<p>Last week a friend of mine asked if I wanted to go to the Roller Disco in Kilbirnie which was on last night. At first I said 'no' but I knew I'd be going.</p>
<p>Glad I did in the end since it was superb entertainment and it lasted almost three hours.</p>
<p>I have my own inline skates which I bought way back in 1999 and probably used them 20 times over the next 2 years. Haven't used them since.</p>
<p>For ages I've been thinking of getting back on them and having a go up and down Oriental Parade - talk about the pressure of not falling - but I always just decided not to. Probably because of what other people think, which flies in the face of the fact that I usually don't care what other (strangers) think.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I'm actually OK on my feet so I'll definitely be 'hitting the streets', or whatever the funky term is these days, and having a bit more of a go.</p>
<p>Remember to say hi if you see me out and about when the weather's nice but please don't take the piss out of my knee, elbow and wrist guards :-)
