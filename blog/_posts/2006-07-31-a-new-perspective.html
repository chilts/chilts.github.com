<p>Sometimes you think that the big things will change your life, but sometimes
it's the smaller things that do it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of days, there has been a few things which made me sit
back and think. I won't go into those things here, but let's just say that
those few things once added together can add together to be more than a
major event.</p>
<p>You think that it's the big things that will change you, a new job, a change
in family circumstances - a death or a birth - a disaster, a relationship,
or even moving house. Now I'm not so sure. Sometimes we prepare too much for
these things to have as big an effect. Sure they change circumstances, but
they don't necessarily shift your outlook. They change your priorities but
not necessarily your habits.</p>
<p>I've had a good few days to think about things, and in addition those points
which made me sit up and channel my thinking a bit more. I think I've
realised which things are important and which aren't. Also, I've realised
what can be done in the position I am. I am priviledged in some respects and
I think it should be used in the right way.</p>
<p>I know this has been a vague entry, but yeah, let's just say I'm happy at
the moment. It seems to be mostly coming together.</p>
