<p>Before I started writing tonight, I ended up catching up with three days worth of blogs. I didn't realise I'd been so busy.</p>
<p>An interesting one I found was <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn's</a> article about <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/2007/10/example-of-subplot-freeing-flame.html">Subplots</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, one of the things I'd been planning this year is to have more than just the main storyline which is what my previous two novels have done (they were very one dimnesional). I have also decided to write in the 3rd person too since NaNo '06 was 1st person and SoCNoC '07 was a mix of both (and a horrible mix of other stuff too).</p>
<p>Already I feel that I'm flowing through this one a lot easier than either of the previous two and you can probably tell this because of my wordcount. After two days, I am already at <strong>6,177</strong>. It's going well so far and I hope to do lots more over the weekend.</p>
<p>For those who have missed it, I'm serialising every single day's writing about <a href="/writing/macy-lights.html">Macy Lights</a>. Day 2 has been posted :-)</p>
