<p>Seeing as everyone else seems to blog about IRC, I thought I'd give an exchange between me and some bots.</p>
<p>The characters are:</p>
<ul><li>pie - that's me</li><li>htaccess - a real person</li><li>tabby (bot) - a random sentence generator</li><li>dullbot (bot) - one who learns from reading other IRC messages</li></ul>
<pre> 15:06 &lt; pie&gt; tabby!
 15:06 &lt; tabby&gt; tabby(TM): Was it good for you too?
 15:06 &lt; pie&gt; absolutely tabby, you're the best
 15:06 &lt; tabby&gt; tabby(TM): Stop that or you'll go blonde! 
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; I already am, you made me tabby
 15:07 &lt; tabby&gt; tabby(TM): 30% less redundant than itself.
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; a-ha, I win
 15:07 &lt;@htaccess&gt; dullbot: pie!
 15:07 &lt; dullbot&gt; htaccess: Look, pie.  We had a nice conversation.
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; dullbot: I thought you'd been evicted from #&lt;channel&gt;
 15:07 &lt; dullbot&gt; pie: No retard, from the moment i left you, this has been a good cat, and a pretty grim thought.
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; lol
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; dullbot: no, you're the best!
 15:07 &lt; dullbot&gt; pie: No, you're the best.
 15:07 &lt; pie&gt; :-)
