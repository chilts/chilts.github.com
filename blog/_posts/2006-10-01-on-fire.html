<p>After three attempts last week and failing miserably, I finally added multi-level lists to Phliky. I'm on fire!</p>
<p>It's Sunday night, I've been hacking and ripping the rest of my CD collection all day (minus the tip trip and the face food stuffing) and I'm finally ready to go to bed in peace...</p>
<p>The reason why is that I finally added multi-level lists to <a href="/software/phliky.html">Phliky</a>. I have numerous automated tests to try it all out and my previous efforts were all failing on the 2nd half. This time, I added some code and ran the tests ... it was perfect.</p>
<p>I even added one more which was a little weird and it still worked. I'm not going to release it onto this website yet since I'll probably make a v0.2 for it and I'll try it out another time.</p>
<p>Now I need sleep but can rest happy I've cracked it.
