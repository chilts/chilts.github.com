<p>Phliky has had some improvements lately and is now on this server - quick test!</p>
<p>Phliky has had two things added to it recently:</p>
<ol><li>the ability to add unordered and ordered lists</li><li>the ability to add definition lists</li></ol>
<p>Like this one:</p>
<p>: Coffee: Black hot drink
Milk: White cold drink</p>
<p>Hopefully, they should work - fingers crossed. After all, I added nine extra tests to check the lists and two tests to check the definition lists.</p>
<p>Seems to work, except my CSS for the definition list is a bit out. Will be fixed another time :-)</p>
