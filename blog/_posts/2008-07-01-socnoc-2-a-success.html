<p>Despite my own failure at doing SoCNoC this year, a number of other people have and it is they I'd like to thank for making SoCNoC what it is.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, a few of us behind the scenes in <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> do lots of work to make sure we're ready for SoCNoC during June. Sometimes it feels like a lot of work but when it starts, it's all worthwhile.</p>
<p>And this year we have managed to break a number of records. Here's a quick run-down of some of the more memorable figures:</p>
<ul><li>143 participants (2.4x last year)</li><li>32 winners (2x last year)</li><li>2,635,755 cumulative words written (2.6x last year)</li><li>58,000 page impressions (2x last year)</li><li>cost - free (same as last year)!</li></ul>
<p>and lots and lots of fun in to the bargain too.</p>
<p>Well done to everyone who completed it. Special congrats. to our organisers who not only did all the work but managed to write a novel too: <a href="http://www.kerrynangell.com/">Kerryn</a>, <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a>, <a href="http://vyanae.blogspot.com/">Cassie</a>, Pam - and hello to <a href="http://angellic.org/">Jane</a> too!</p>
<p>Here's looking forward to a record breaking 3rd SoCNoC next year!
