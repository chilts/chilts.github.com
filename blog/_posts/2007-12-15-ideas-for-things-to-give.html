<p>Here is a few ideas of things to give for presents if you so insist on it.</p>
<p>
In my last post, I complained that <a href="the-christmas-circus-and-the-commercial-merry-go-round.html">giving presents at Christmas was a waste of time and money</a> so go and read that post if you have the time. Alternatively, this is a much happier and less cynical post :-)</p>
<p>So this is the list of ideas of gifts that I would like if you <strong>insist</strong> on giving me something.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel that there are many more worthy causes for your money than I so here are my suggestions on what I would consider a good present.</p>
<p>The first is easy:</p>
<ul><li>give some money to a charity of your choosing and tell me about it</li></ul>
<p>I don't really even care who to or how much since whoever you give it to will be a charity that <strong>you</strong> consider to be a good cause and that will be good enough for me. Of course, you <strong>can</strong> tell me who and how much but I will only be interested in the former.</p>
<p>The second thing you could do is 'gift' me one of the following, or something of the like:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.wwf.org.nz/index.php/take_action/adopt_a_hectors_dolphin/adopt_now/">an adopted Hector's dolphin</a></li><li><a href="https://www2.worldvision.org.nz/Catalogue/GiftsOfHope/">give a Gift of Hope</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.e-xpert.co.nz/forestandbird/forestandbird/Donation.aspx?sPage=Donation">donate to Forest and Bird</a></li><li>another NZ-based green charity</li></ul>
<p>or alternatively, if you want to give me something physical, try this (and yes, it is slightly commercial):</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.nztreesplease.com/">give me a tree please</a> (native only)</li></ul>
<p>So there you go, anything on that list would make me happy though still, you should go from the top down.
