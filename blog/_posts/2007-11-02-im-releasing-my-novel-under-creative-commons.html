<p>After attending the launch of the NZ versions of the Creative Commons licenses, I've decided to release this, my third novel, under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a> site and NZ specific licenses were launched last Saturday and I had the pleasure of attending. It was a fantastic event but I shall be writing it up another time. Let's just say that I was amazed at the number and type of people who turned up.</p>
<p>In honour of the new license, I shall be making my NaNoWriMo 2007 novel available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 3.0 New Zealand License</a>.</p>
<p>The novel is called <a href="/writing/macy-lights.html">Macy Lights and the Battle for Ashton's Gate</a> and I shall be filling in each day's quota, so check back every day for a new installment.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, I shall tie up all the pieces together and produce a book that I will print using <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a>. You are welcome to order a copy off me (to be honest, it's not going to be that good but hey, it's for the kids) and any profits will be given to a charity to be determined by me - I hope to find a writing/reading based charity here in New Zealand, so I'd appreciate any comments. Unfortunately, price is also to be determined but I don't expect it to be too high.</p>
<p>Depending on demand (yeah right) will depend on when and how many I order, so please be patient.</p>
<p>Overall, this is mostly an interesting excercise for me so it'll be interesting to see how it turns out.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.
