<p>I'm not talking about me having an epiphany about the web, I'm talking about using the Epiphany Browser instead of Firefox.</p>
<p>For a while now, my <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser has been going in fits and starts. More often than not it starts winding up to 100% CPU and that's just silly. My browser is fairly plain vanilla with just a few minor extensions so who knows what's causing it.</p>
<p>I have been using Google Maps quite a lot recently and I'm thinking it has to do with that, but really, it's far too often getting it's knickers in a twist.</p>
<p>Also a few other things have been getting on my nerves recently. For example, if I'm editing inside a text box, I can't Ctrl-PgUp/PgDn since the text box keeps the focus and gives you options for previous things you've typed in there in the past - not a feature I <strong>ever</strong> use.</p>
<p>So I decided last night to give <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> a go. Many years ago I'd played with <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon</a> from which Epiphany grew and also had an itch to give it another go. A couple of years ago it still didn't seem to be what I wanted but nowadays it seems fantastic.</p>
<p>So far, it's been a breath of fresh air. It's responsive, it renders really fast (oh I know it uses Gecko which Firefox does, it just seems faster) and there isn't tonnes of cruft to get in the way. I don't need or use history, I keep my bookmarks online and most things I do, I use the mouse for. It's a small slimline browser which goes wonderfully with my minimal desktop (I use <a href="http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/">Ion3</a>).</p>
<p>Also, using Google Maps never seems to slow it down ever though I'm sure it's quite intensive. I've had 4 tabs open on 4 different pages with maps on them, a load of Flickr pages, lots of Wikipedia pages and other random pages and it's still super responsive. Apart from not stealing all the CPU it also just <strong>feels</strong> fast for the simple things like switching from tab to tab, which I do a lot.</p>
<p>I don't think I can fully switch yet since I need to check out the extension mechanism but so far, it's looking really promising. I'll definately switch on my home computer at some stage, maybe I'll keep using Firefox on my work one.</p>
<p>Yet another demonstration how free and open source software works. If something better comes along, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to try it out :-)
