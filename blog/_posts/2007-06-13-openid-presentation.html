<p>Last night I did an OpenID presentation to the Wellington PerlMongers.</p>
<p>I think it went okay. It had a fair bit of introduction to OpenID and a bit more Perl later on. There were lots of questions about it. I think it's one of those things that people have heard about but never really looked at it. So hopefully, it'll get people talking about it a bit more and maybe even have a play with it.</p>
<p>I think it's quite cool and my example (which I'll tart up one day and put here) works quite well.</p>
<p>There were some things I couldn't work out about it though so I'll have to try one of the other modules.</p>
<p>I'll add the link to the slides once I get them up and going.</p>
