<p>I just attended a fantastic talk by George Gibbs about his new book, 'Ghosts of Gondwana'.</p>
<p>I became a member of the <a href="http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/">Karori Wildlife Sanctuary</a> in January after going twice in December and January. As well as being able to get into the sanctuary for a year, I didn't realise that I also get a newsletter and the ability to attend seminars that are on 4 times a year.</p>
<p>Tonight was the first one I was able to attend and it was amazing. The seminar was on <a href="http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/whatsnew/stories/MembersSeminar20Mar2007.html">The History of Life in New Zealand</a> and it was presented by George Gibbs. His new book, <a href="http://www.craigpotton.co.nz/products/published/books/bookgeneralnonfiction/ghostsofgondwana">Ghosts of Gondwana</a>, explains a lot but he managed to talk about some of the things that didn't make it into the book.</p>
<p>Learning about the unique fauna of New Zealand is fascinating since we separated from Gondwanaland over 100 million years ago. He told us how some geologists have the theory called &quot;The Drowning of New Zealand&quot; where <em>Zealandier</em> (a geologist term for the larger landmass that originally split off) basically went underwater for a time about 25 MYA - a theory he doesn't subscribe to but interesting to know about.</p>
<p>Of course, this theory would mean that all the animals here would have had to have come here since then. This would also show a major change in the pollen records too but that doesn't look to have been the case. Finally, fossil records here are severely lacking since the country has changed so much over time (and still is) that there isn't that many about apart from a new discovery in Otago. So that doesn't help us either.</p>
<p>(Note: all of this is information in passing, I hold no guarantees any of what I said is right and I also missed out a big chunk of his talk. That's about as much as I understand it anyway.)</p>
<p>My mate came along too and bought himself a copy of the hardback book. He also got it signed by the author, George Gibbs, so that was cool too.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the next seminar. Whatever that is about, I hope it is as interesting as this one was.
