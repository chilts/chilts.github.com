<p>This month has been hectic. Last month was mad too because I moved house. Work has been crazy recently too.</p>
<p>This month, I signed up for doing a novel. Seeing as I am a founder member of KiwiWriters, I have to do it. So far, I haven't managed to get into it yet but then finally, when I thought work would settle down, it went beserk again. Hopefully it <strong>will</strong> settle down sometime soon otherwise I'll never get this thing written.</p>
<p>I'm happy and settled into the new flat now though so that helps. Finally I can see the carpet which is always a bonus.</p>
<p>And then, when I thought I'd be able to get into my novel for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2008.html">SoCNoC</a>, I somehow volunteered to do a talk at <a href="http://wellingt.pm.org/">PerlMongers</a> tomorrow night (Tuesday). Silly me.</p>
<p>Then again, I've just written the talk and I'm happy with it. It's only short but I'm hoping to open it out into a discussion at the end of the presentation. It's about my idea of a distributed issue tracking program, initially conceived as '<a href="/software/cil.html">cil</a>'. There are already a few people interested in it including both <a href="http://nigel.mcnie.name/">Nigel</a> and <a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/">Francois</a> so hopefully, they'll ship me patches (hint hint ...) though their ideas have already been immensely invaluable. Thanks lads, it's always a pleasure prying into your brains.
