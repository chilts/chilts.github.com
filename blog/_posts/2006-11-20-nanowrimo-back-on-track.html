<p>After pulling out all of the stops these past 9 days, I'm now back on track to completion.</p>
<p>The best part about it is that my novel is getting more and more exciting every day I write some. It's been gaining momentum for the past week now and I'm still about 3 days (of writing) away from the climax!</p>
<p>I feel it's just flying off my fingers at the moment, so at least that means I should be able to continue and make the 50,000, especially since the amount I have to write has now come down to below 1,600 per day.</p>
<p>Finally, to all those keeping track of my progress, or any other Wrimo's progress, I challenge you to do it next year. I have already said that this will be one of my most favourite personal achievements so why not give it a go. I know I'm not finished yet, but either way it's been really good and just keeps getting better.</p>
<p>I went along the weekly Wellington Write-In at the library yesterday and one of the other Wrimo's mentioned a few novels which happened to be around 50,000 words. I didn't realise this but when you think of the likes of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; which you have held in your hand at one time or another, well this will equate to that - if only in volume :-)</p>
<p>When I print it out at the end of the month, I think my smile will be broader than my face!
