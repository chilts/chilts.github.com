<p>...and not very happy with the downtime... :-(</p>
<p>So <a href="http://easyspeedy.com">my dodgy server provider</a> had major routing problems on Saturday. This continued into Sunday. Monday was completely wiped out and I'm back just about the end of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apologies to anyone trying to get the site but I tried my hardest to get them to fix it - and even when they said they did, it still didn't work.</p>
<p>Now, just to put the other side of the story, I've been using EasySpeedy since March and have been so happy with them, I like them, they were the cheapest I found at the time (and have now found <a href="http://serverpronto.com">ServerPronto</a> which is cheaper still - by far) and have, up until now, given me no hassle whatsoever.</p>
<p>I know that these things happen, that either servers might go down, or routing problems happen, but the fact that it took <strong>four days</strong> to come back is a little disturbing. And when they did say that it was resolved, it wasn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, am I glad I can see these pages again...I've kinda missed them.</p>
