<p>On Saturday I spent a large part of it talking to other geeks and generally just hanging out.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.softwarefreedomday.org.nz/">Software Freedom Day</a> there was both a barcamp and a hackfest, though I only made it to the barcamp. I've been to hackfests before and just wanted to see what the unconference was like.</p>
<p>It turns out it was good. One of the sessions I went to wasn't quite so good, one was just chatting with a couple of others, in one I learnt alot about <a href="http://xapian.org/">Xapian</a> (which looks really good) and in another we talked about distributed source control and other things (but mainly focused around <a href="http://repo.or.cz/">Git</a>).</p>
<p>The setting in the town hall was pretty good though the layout of the rooms was such that there was always a 'front'. What I would have liked to have seen was more a 'circle' so (like I commented at the end of the day) everybody who turns up is on an equal footing with anyone already there.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not a fan of the rooms with projectors in them. Not only does this focus to the person in control of the projector but what should be an informal chat session gets hijacked by the people who were able to get in with slides beforehand. I understand that some of these people are sponsors of the event (for which we truly are grateful) but please, just say it's a presentation and not pretend that it isn't. At least that way we know what we're getting ourselves in for.</p>
<p>The hackfest area seemed to be really lively those couple of times I did go through though I suspect I'll still stay in the unconference next year (let's face it, I hack with people at <a href="http://shdh.org.nz/">SHDH</a> once a month already).</p>
<p>So overall, a really enjoyable day and a great day to chat to random other people. Can't wait for next year already. Congrats. and thanks to the organisers for putting up the whole show.
