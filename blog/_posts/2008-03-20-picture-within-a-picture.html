<p>There's something quite nice about this photo, for more than one reason.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me tell you what <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theshadowdancer/2337078086/">this photo</a> is all about.</p>
<p>It was recently Flickr's 4th birthday and they were having a party. To celebrate, they printed out 3,800 photos and put them all up on display. So I added one of mine to the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/flickrturns4/">Flickr turns 4</a> pool so they could use it. Here's the one I added.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andychilton/2233661009"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2257/2233661009_f8896ed864_m.jpg" /></a>

<p>After the event, I saw a Flickr blog item which showed a number of the boards upon which they stuck all the photos. After a bit of searching, I eventually found a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/67872334@N00/2336923636/">board with my photo on it</a>.</p>
<p>But even better, in the <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/03/19/flickr-turns-4/">most recent Flickr blog entry</a>, there was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theshadowdancer/2337078086/">another photo which also showed mine</a> (bottom left). On the board, mine is the one 3rd from the left and 5th from the bottom.</p>
<p>It's not often you get your photo onto the Flickr blog even if it is a picture within a picture within a page.
