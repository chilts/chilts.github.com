<p>Just a few days before my SoCNoC novel starts, I've finally done a brief outline of my story. Please comment and let me know what you think.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Computers don't run off electricity. They run because each and every one of them have some <em>little people</em> who live inside. The <em>little people</em> keep everything working from opening and closing gates, charging the batteries and moving all those teeny-tiny electrons around.</p>
<p>As it turns out <strong>'Bit'</strong> and <strong>'Byte'</strong> (who are twins and the logical opposite of each other) want to escape from their home computer. Through cunning tactics they switch, charge and spark themselves through the wires. Finally they manage to escape but unfortunately find themselves in the big bad <strong>'Outernet'</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the adventure they have battling viruses, spy-ware, drive-by-downloads and ultimately come up against the evil <strong>SpamBot</strong>! They also find time to fix broken sites, help with compatibility problems and even spell check a webpage or two.</p>
<p>Their plan is to get back to <strong>'localhost.localmachine'</strong>, their own home.</p>
<p>On their own, this would be a hard task (I mean, who can map-read through network switches anyway), but by making friends with other little people who can help them, they might just do it.
