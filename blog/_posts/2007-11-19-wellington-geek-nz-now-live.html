<p>Brenda and I have been working on a new site for all the Wellington Geeks out there. And it's now live.</p>
<p>After trying to do about a thousand things this month, one of them is mostly ready. <a href="http://www.coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> and I have been working on <strong>http://wellington.geek.nz/ (deprecated) http://wellington.geek.nz/</strong> recently and it looks like people have found it before we were fully ready to release.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that's okay, <strong>Release Early, Release Often</strong> is the Open Source mantra so that just means we get more eyeballs at it earlier rather than later.</p>
<p>One good thing is that doing the site made me add a new <strong>Calendar</strong> model to <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> and now that's up and going very well. We'll also use the new Calendar model over on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> so everyone will know when all the challenges are. It's great how all these sites benefit from each other :-)</p>
<p>The one issue I need to fix up for wellington.geek.nz is the fact that it thinks it's yesterday for most of today since the server is running on Central European Time (it's in Denmark), but I'll fix that up soon when I get a chance.</p>
<p>We have some thoughts and ideas for the future so hopefully some of these will be added in the near future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>being able to change the right hand calendar to Next/Prev month</li>
  <li>RSS feeds for the events</li><li>iCal feeds that you can put in your own calendar tools</li>
</ul>
<p>... and probably more, so let us know if you have any suggestions. The site is still beta (I've always wanted to say that) so please be kind.
</p>
