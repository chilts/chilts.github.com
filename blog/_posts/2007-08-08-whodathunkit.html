<p>So at the ripe old age of 31 and a half, I have won my first ever sports award.</p>
<p>Yes, the lads pulled through in the final tonight and we won our league. See the results below.</p>

<p>So yeah, the figure that stands out for me is that we scored a <strong>lot</strong> of goals. I think I contributed about 10 :-) And for each game we did:</p>

<p>Not sure how we lost to <em>Serie A</em> in the league (I was away that week) but after we saw it was <em>Sift</em> in the final and we'd beaten them before, we thought we had a chance. Funny thing being that we also lost to <em>Jones Lang La Salle</em> in the league but we did well against them.</p>
<p>Overall, I figured my performance tonight was my best in the season so far. I think I was just a little rusty at the start (and not as fit) but it's coming together.</p>
<p>So anyway, we all got an award which says:</p>
<p class="c">Wellington Indoor Sports<br />
Queens Wharf Indoor Soccer<br />
<em>Autumn League 2007 Major Final Winners</em></p>
<p>Who'd a thunk it?</p>
<p>But at the same time, it's crap that they're planning on <a href="http://www.saveoursport.wellington.net.nz/Shed1.html">pulling Shed 1 down</a> and putting some stupid crappy hotel piece of rubbish on there instead.
