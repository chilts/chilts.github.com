<p>I decided to submit Zaapt, my CMS, to Ohloh and here's the results.</p>
<p>The page for <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6517">Zaapt on Ohloh</a> shows a few interesting things about <strong>zaapt.org.nz (deprecated) Zaapt the CMS</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, they show that I have done 3,039 lines of code, by hook or by crook (of course, they don't know that I have Perl generating at least a thousand or so <strong>more</strong> than that). I thought I'd done more than that, but hey, at least it's succinct. As it stands, they estimate that, at something less than <strong>1 Person Year</strong> averaging <strong>$55,000USD a year</strong> then the Zaapt code base is worth a whopping <strong>$34,834USD</strong>.</p>
<p>It turns out that Zaapt is 7 months old today so I reckon I've done well to get it where it is now. Though I don't believe the calculations Ohloh generates I guess it's just an indication of what's been happening on the project.</p>
<p>What's more interesting is the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6517/analyses/latest">code analysis</a> page. I always think I comment code about right - who doesn't? - so I might have to compare (my 12.1%) with other projects and see where it fits in. I suspect that the weird mix of HTML/Perl in Mason might throw the '<em>Languages</em>' used off a bit. Certainly there is more than 3% HTML and much less than 73% Perl so I reckon all Mason files are treated as solely Perl.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6517/analyses/latest/contributors">Contributors</a> section (yes, I'm the only one), the other feature I find quite useful is <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/5972/positions/2769">my personal metrics for Zaapt</a>. It's nice to see how many commits and lines I'm changing (per language and) overall on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>It's just a bit of fun so I'm not too bothered what it says, but it is interesting. I'd also like to know what adding the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> repository would make all these figures. Unfortunately that SVN isn't public so I can't. Maybe I'd hit <strong>$50,000USD</strong> for half a year's very part-time work.</p>
<p>Not bad eh!
