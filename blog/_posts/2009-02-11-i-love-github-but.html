<p>...sometimes it can only go so far.</p>
<p>The fantastic people at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> have released yet another feature to their already impressive hosting service. They are now offering downloads for which I initially became very happy.</p>
<p>Until I read the fine print.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://github.com/blog/350-repository-uploads">their blog entry</a> about it and let me know what you think (and yes, you may have already spotted the <a href="http://github.com/blog/350-repository-uploads#comment_1479">comment I left there</a>).</p>
<p>It's a fantastic service, GitHub rolls updates out very frequently, I've only ever seen it problematic once and I've consistently been impressed with how much they're doing for the open source community.</p>
<p>So why in the world would you use flash? I quote:</p>
<blockquote>If youâ€™re still one of the holdouts, do yourself a favor and install Flash ... [snip]</blockquote>
<p>I'm afraid it's not going to happen. Not only am I adverse to proprietary software I think it also smells of a closed web, something which I'm sure the GitHub guys are also adverse to.</p>
<p>Also, the only reason they're doing it is so that uploads can bypass their own servers ... something to do with going straight into <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> I presume. Ok, that may be so, but really?</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>Having to install Silverlight to perform an upload to a server. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure a pretty early version of HTML allowed uploads of files to servers many, many years ago.
