<p>Brenda is definately getting known these days. Involved in lots of groups, starting many of them and now this.</p>
<p><a href="http://wellington.girlgeekdinners.co.nz/">Wellington Geek Girl Dinners</a> obviously went well the other week but it seems to have already made news elsewhere - like on the <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/03/wellington-girl-geek-dinners.html">Google Open Source blog</a> (stumbled across in my feedreader).</p>
<p>Well done <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>!
