<p>I wasn't going to do NaNo this year but it just wouldn't feel right if I didn't. So I am.</p>
<p>Already things are getting exciting. The new <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNo</a> site is up (still some teething problems but I'm sure they'll get it sorted). And for the geeks, it's now using Drupal.</p>
<p>Loads of names I know from last year are already on the forums, but even better I know more of them since many from <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> are also over there too. Added to this, we're getting crossover from NaNo and our KiwiWriters membership has gone up a lot over the past two weeks and hopefully some more during November.</p>
<p>The Manawatu Standard is being the best local paper which supports writing events like this one with this article - <a href="http://stuff.co.nz/manawatustandard/4239639a6502.html">Have you got the write stuff?</a>. Hopefully more of them will promote it too since it's a very enjoyable month - of course I have a view that they might support us with <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/socnoc/">SoCNoC</a> next year too.</p>
<p>It's all very exciting.
