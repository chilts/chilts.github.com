<p>NaNo has just put their widgets up again and there are more features than last year.</p>
<pre>
Instead of posting a load of links to them here (since blog entries are timed and these things keep changing), I'll just post the final versions at the end of the month.</pre>
<p>I have posted two on my <a href="/">home page</a> if you want to take a look how I'm going.</p>
<p>On the left is the Word War widget on which I've added myself, <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a> and <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a>.</p>
<p>On the right is my progress through the month.</p>
<p>I think that they've put some serious caching onto the widgets, so I think they'll only update every day or two. I reckon just putting a few hours on it would suffice but that's alright, better to have late ones than none at all :-)</p>
<p>Actually, I think the progress one is going off another timezone (one much behind ours) and that it'll only be generated after midnight of that day. That's why it says 22 days left. I dunno but there's something weird about it.
