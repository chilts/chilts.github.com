<p>I have added a new challenge in Kiwi Writers, is small and simple. Why don't you join us?</p>
<p>Have a look at my latest challenge on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org">Kiwi Writers</a>., It is <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/challenges/86.html">A Descriptive Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>It's only small, will take only half an hour per day over this coming Friday, Saturday and Sunday and is really easy. Why not come and <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">Join Us</a> and join in the fun.</p>
<p>Progress can be posted in the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/">writing forums</a> and usually there are people offering encouragement there too.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for?
