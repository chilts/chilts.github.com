<p>A number of things which are near and dear to me at the moment, and chromatic talks about them all.</p>
<p>In his post <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/08/constraints_and_software_devel.html">Constraints and Software Development</a>, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/176">chromatic</a> talks about writing, software and volunteer projects.</p>
<p>Hmm, has he been reading my blog - it pretty much touches on everything I seem to be doing at the moment :-)</p>
<p>And yes, kapiti.geek.nz has a new design, courtesy of <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.org/">Free CSS Templates</a>. Thanks muchly. But better than that, it is now using <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> :-)
