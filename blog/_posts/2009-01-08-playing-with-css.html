<p>Over the past couple of months, I've implemented a new site in Zaapt. Usually I take a design with HTML and CSS and just use it straight but this time, I wanted to write the HTML and CSS myself.</p>
<p>I first found a theme I liked which had been converted from a WordPress theme to a <a href="http://itheme3right.blogspot.com/">BlogSpot theme</a>. Then I found the original <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/demo/wordpress/">WordPress theme</a>.</p>
<p>But of course, I wanted to implement it in Zaapt so I converted it to a Zaapt theme. Over the space of a couple of months, it also meant that I added a few extra features to the blog model, which included an archive list as well as a category list. Anyway, that isn't the discussion of this entry.</p>
<h2>Doing the Layout in CSS</h2>
<p>A little while ago, I stumbled across a site called <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> and I immediately thought it looked good. It turns out that getting a 2 or 3 column layout is pretty easy and so good I used it on the new site. Then all I had to do was re-implement all the important parts of the WordPress/BlogSpot templates but ignoring all the cruft that goes along with it (Zaapt is nice in that it's templates don't have to be over complex).</p>
<p>Anyway, to take a look at the new site head over to my Personal Finance blog <a href="/retire-at-40/">Retire at 40</a> (over 150 subscribers now). The columns were damn easy to do and the <code>reset.css</code> stylesheet from the 960.gs set means you start all browsers off on the same foot.</p>
<p>Of course, IE is giving me grief in versions 5.5, 6 and 7 (Update: IE 8 actually looks ok) as can be seen by <a href="http://browsershots.org/http://www.retire-at-40.com/">BrowserShots</a> - which by the way, is one funky-ass site but you know, I'm not too worried though but I'd be happy if I could get a solution. Firefox looks just beautiful.</p>
<p>Isn't that always the way?
