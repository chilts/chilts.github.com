<p>I've added some more pics to my Flickr account.</p>
<p>When I first started this blog, I did a few weeks with a WPoW - &quot;Wellington Picture of the Week&quot;, but it turns out I didn't do it for long.</p>
<p>Anyway, with my new camera, I'm uploading bits and pieces and will blog about one or two here. Don't worry, I won't go over the top with photos, just one or two posts a week maybe.</p>
<p>Here's todays, taken in Seatoun:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andychilton/2197364870/" title="20080112_182353 by andychilton, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/2197364870_67edca5dc7_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="20080112_182353" /></a>
</div>
<p>Hope you like it.</p>
<p>And as with most things I do these days, I'm giving it away free.
