Yes, I know "commits" are about as informative as "Lines of Code" but it does sometimes help you see where you are in comparison to other days.

Thanks to the terrible Wellington weather I stayed home all day and hacked. It was awesome. It turns out I did 32 commits today to my current project. Correction, I have two projects on the go (one at home and one at the office). This is for the one I'm doing at home. After all that I am (1) tired, (2) chuffed I was so productive and (3) happy!

The most interesting of these of course is (2). I have found that since I quit my job and am doing my own thing, I am almost infinitely more productive. Firstly, I know the ins and outs of the system, secondly I have no interruptions (irc, email, phone, in-person, clients) and finally, all my projects are just so much more interesting than previous things I've worked on. And yep, that includes a satellite control system! :)
