<p>After being up and going for a few months, my first comment spam appeared. Time to brace myself...</p>
<p>I'm sure more and more will come, though at least I can reject it easily enough.</p>
<p>All the comment contained were a load of links to dodgy medicine (and non-medicine) based 'performance' enhancers etc etc Not that the links would show since I HTML-escape the comments, but still you could read them.</p>
<p>Which leads me to think I need another feature in my blog software. Once a comment comes in, I can either accept or reject it - generally I accept. This is just a status column in the blogs.comment table.</p>
<p>This leads me to think I'll add a delete button too. Even though the 'reject' works functionally (ie. it doesn't show the comment on the page) a 'delete' will also stop it taking up space in my database.</p>
<p>Not that I'm short of disk space (wouldn't that be bad), just that I'd rather it didn't exist at all.
