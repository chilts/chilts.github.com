<p>It seems it is still somewhat unofficial, but Google intend to allow you OAuth access to your data. Excellent news!</p>
<p>It also seems that Google are planning to open up all of it's Data APIs to be OAuth capable, starting with the Contacts API.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oauth/browse_thread/thread/75ee6d973930c791">this announcement</a> in the OAuth group.</p>
<p>Well done Google. That's a great step forward. Now let's see it keep going that way.
