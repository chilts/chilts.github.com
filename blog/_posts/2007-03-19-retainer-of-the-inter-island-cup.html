<p>I took my golf clubs down to Christchurch for the weekend and beat my brother-in-law by one shot.</p>
<p>I was lucky to be honest and he was unlucky, but still, I retain the inter-island cup - a small competition we have each time we meet up. Usually we just make rules up at a driving range but this time I took my clubs down and we played a full round.</p>
<p>The course was nice (it was by Darfield, I forget the name) and was mostly forgiving. It was very dry though that didn't really matter and is to be expected on the Canterbury plains at this time of year. The greens though were absolutely lush and were like walking on carpet.</p>
<p>For $15 a round and there being no-one in front of us and no-one behind us, it was a very enjoyable round. A putt on the first hole and a chip onto the green around the 8th or 9th were my best shots.</p>
<p>I think I got 118, which doesn't sound good in itself, but I haven't played for about 9 months so I'm happy with that.
