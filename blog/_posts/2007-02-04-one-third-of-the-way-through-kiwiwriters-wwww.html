<p>wwwW stands for Waitangi Weekend Word Wace and it's a site-wide challenge on KiwiWriters.org to write a short story.</p>
<p>If you've never written a short story before (like me), then it's an ideal chance to try something different. A short story is generally regarded as being around 7,500 words. For this year, since Waitangi Day is on Tuesday, we're suggesting writing a short story between midnight Friday and midnight Tuesday.</p>
<p>So far, it's been really enjoyable though I am finding it harder than NaNoWriMo. The aim of writing a short story means it's harder to find padding to fill out the words since you really have to keep the story going. I'd never thought of this before but it has been driven home to me by the act of doing it. Also see this thread on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/write-it/36.html">getting the words out</a> on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters.org</a>.</p>
<p>Overall though, I'm on course and should be able to manage another 2,500 each day to get the 7,500 needed.
