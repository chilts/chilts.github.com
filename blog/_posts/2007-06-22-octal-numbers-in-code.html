<p>I always thought putting a single zero in front of Octal numbers in code was pretty bad, or at least, pretty error-prone. But someone is doing something about it.</p>
<p>In this article, <a href=" http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208549">Python 3000 Status Update</a>, Guido van Rossum is putting a new syntax in for Octal numbers and Binary numbers too (see 'Other Significant Changes' towards the bottom).</p>
<p>Not that I ever use them much, but I think it will help. In fact, I said to someone at least a few years ago that '0o....' should be used for Octal numbers :-)
