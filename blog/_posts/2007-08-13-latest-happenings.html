<p>Just a quick catch up on what I've been doing.</p>
<p>This past two weeks, it seems I've been out more than I've been in. Take this last week, you know I went for <a href="long-time.html">Rock'n'Roll</a> on Monday and <a href="whodathunkit.html">Indoor Soccer</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Well, I also went to see <a href="http://www.dannybhoy.com/dannybhoy/">Danny Bhoy</a> on Thursday (who is the funniest comedian I've ever seen, no doubt about it) and went to see the <a href="http://www.wellingtonphoenix.com/">Wellington Phoenix</a> on Friday. I'll get a season ticket for that very soon.</p>
<p>But, the best thing is, even though it's been busy, I have managed to add a new <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/blog/new-gallery-content-type.html (deprecated) Gallery</strong> type to <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong>. It's mostly finished with a few tweaks to make but it is site usable already. I shall be using it on a site very soon - which will be posted here - so watch out for that.
