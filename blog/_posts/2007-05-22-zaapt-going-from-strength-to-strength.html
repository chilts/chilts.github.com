<p>Recently I mentioned I'd added the ability add friends for users of a Zaapt site - well there's more!</p>
<p>I've now added the ability to Message each other - basically, a very simple form of email. It's small, it's funky and it works really well.</p>
<p>Granted some features are missing, but those are features for email clients and there's no way I'm implementing all that. Instead, people will use personal messaging on the site for two reasons:</p>
<ol><li>so they can swap email addresses and communicate</li><li>so they don't have to swap email addresses and can still communicate</li></ol>
<p>It's great. It also means we can chat to other users privately which helps from an admin point of view too!</p>
<p>Anyway, even though <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> still remains the main showcase for Zaapt (and probably always will be), I don't mind and it's only a matter of time before they both become really big!
