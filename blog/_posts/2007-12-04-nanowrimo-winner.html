<p>So I'm late posting this - about winning - but better late than never.</p>
<p>November and NaNoWriMo turned out to be awesomly hard this year. I think this was because I was working a lot at the start of the month so it consumed more time than I wanted it to. But I clawed the words back towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>You can see from <a href="/writing/macy-lights.html">my progress</a> that I did quite a few days of over 4,000 words and even managed 5.6k on the last day (though I remember doing a 6k day last year). Then again, I didn't write on 10 days, which meant my average was over 2.5k a day.</p>
<p>Anyway, winners certificate:</p>

<p>The current status of the novel is that there are about 3 scenes to go so probably just a few thousand words. I told this to the others during the TGIO party on Sunday but no-one believe me that I'll finish it off - hehe, like my previous two novels. This year, I'm determined to prove them wrong (naming no names but <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a> and <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a> are the main two non-believers). Just you wait and see!</p>
<p>P.S. That image was uploaded using the new(ish) file upload feature of Zaapt which I just <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/zaapt-commit/browse_thread/thread/1667d77e064d0fe7">fixed to work properly with Apache2</a> :-)
