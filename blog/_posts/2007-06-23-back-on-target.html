<p>After a few days where I was behind the daily projected average, I'm now back on target for getting the novel completed.</p>
<p>This week, I've managed to pull off quite a few words. So I reckon about 10,000 in about 6 days. Funny thing is, while that sounds like it'd on track, I had a few days where I was behind.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a number of 2k's and a 4k one day, I'm back on track.</p>
<p>In other news, the collective word count for the whole of <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> is now over three quarters of a millions words!!! I find it amazing that something a small group of us started can get so big!</p>
<p>Go take a look at the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2007.html">SoCNoC challenge</a> page. We already have 3 winners and I think a good number of other people are still in with a chance to complete it too.</p>
