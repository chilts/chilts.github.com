<p>After my post the other day regarding moving to Seatoun, I went back to Paraparaumu - and it was lovely. But confirmation of the beauty around here also hit home this week.</p>
<p>The weather up in Kapiti was great today. I had to go up there on errand, but after that was finished, a couple of friends and I went for a walk on the beach.</p>
<p>It's not the nicest beach to sit on, but then, I think sitting on a beach is a waste of time. It is, however, an excellent beach for walking along. It's very intriguing along there in that lots and lots of sealife gets washed up onto it. We saw many fantastic curly shells, lots of driftwood and a few half-rotting fish.</p>
<p>In other news, I went to see Comet McNaught again last night. Although it wasn't as bright as last week, it is still spectacular.</p>
<p>I do find it amusing however that a group of us has been us up at least 3 times each week recently with no-one else around but last night there were a whole host of other people. Funny how they all come out of the woodwork on a Saturday night. Also annoying that loads of them had torches and were shining them into lots of faces - my eyes were just about adjusting and bang straight into my eyes they shine.</p>
<p>Thank you, thanks a lot.
