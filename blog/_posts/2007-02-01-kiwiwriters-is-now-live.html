<p>Go check it out, post a challenge, wander around the forums and join in the fun.</p>
<p>After just over a month of solid and rapid development, Project X, oopse, I mean <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters.org</a> is now live. This also means that the features I have implemented in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Zaapt</a> already are also out there and being used :-)</p>
<p>But more to the point, there are many many interesting things going on over at <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/about.html">KiwiWriters.org</a>. For example, the forums are already bustling and there are a few challenges already outlined.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed doing <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> last November, then we'll be presenting a similar event in June for the Southern Hemisphere. It's called SoCNoC (pronounced sock-nock) and stands for <em>Southern Cross Novel Challenge</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the site is based around Challenges and the first one we'll be presenting is the <em>Waitangi Weekend Word Wace</em>. The aim of this challenge is to write a short story over this 4 day weekend, from midnight Friday until midnight Tuesday. It should be heaps of fun.</p>
<p>Finally, other people are already posting their challenges too. For example, today we had a short <em>Limerick Lunchtime</em> and there will be a comedy weekend next week to try your hand at a different style of writing.</p>
<p>Overall it's going to be lots of fun and all of us in <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/staff.html">KiwiWriters</a> are already proud of our achievement. I must admit however that I'm really really happy I've managed (I think) to get the site going in a little over a month or so. So why not <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">Join Us</a> and tell us what you think.</p>
