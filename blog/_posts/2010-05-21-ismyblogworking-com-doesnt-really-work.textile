I got an item in my RSS feed the other day. It was for my old (hardly used, one careful owner) site www.pie.geek.nz. I have let it lapse since I never really used it, hence DNS broke.

It read:

<pre>Your blog is broken:
DNS failure.
Last change in status was Sun, 02 May 2010 11:28:00 +0000
</pre>

Great, except it gave me this update on the 19th May. That means it took 17 days for the ismyblogworking.com service to tell me. Hardly a recommendation for you to use it.

For some reason I expect that if I sign up to a service which tells you if your blog is broken, it would notify you a little quicker than 17 days. All good fun.
