<p>I'm off to a good start, but there is so much more I need to do</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening when I was in bed, I couldn't get to sleep because I was thinking of NaNoWriMo. When I turned over, I saw that the clock was 11:57. Three minutes later it turned 12:00 and I started to get excited again.</p>
<p>Lieing there, I swear I could hear the faint tapping on keyboards all around New Zealand seeing as we're one of the first to start!</p>
<p>So Wednesday was the big day. I didn't really think about it much in the daytime, but on the train home, I finally plooted out most of the novel. In the evening I filled it all in before I started the actual writing which came much later.</p>
<p>By the end of Wednesday though, I had managed 1769 words which I was quite pleased with.</p>
<p>Thursday I was busy with other things but managed another thousand between 10:50pm and midnight, which I thought was good going. I'm currently on 2745.</p>
<p>So far, so good, though I have to do at least two hours tonight and lots more over the weekend.</p>
<p>BTW: Many thanks to <code>wc -w novel</code> for helping me out with the counting :-) I mean, it was crap in school having to count all your words for an essay wasn't it?
