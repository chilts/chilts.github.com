<p>The Google Chart API now supports QR codes.</p>
<p><a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/07/qr-codes-now-available-on-google-chart.html">QR Codes now available on the Google Chart API</a>. Here's mine for <strong>http://kapiti.geek.nz (deprecated)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/s/files/kapiti-geek-nz-qr-code.png" /></p>
<p>And the <a href="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=150x150&amp;cht=qr&amp;chl=http://kapiti.geek.nz/">link</a> I did it with.</p>
<p>I originally saw this because Brad Fitz has used it to put on his Facebook <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2387582.html">profile image</a> which is interesting.</p>
<p>I guess if image search engines want to know where an image originally came from, they can scan for the QR Code</p>
<p>Taking this futher, I can think of one really good use already. You could put it on your <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licensed <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> images and that way, the attribution part of publisher's side of the deal is already fulfilled. That can only be a good thing (as to whether they want a black and white pattern in the corner of their published images is a different story).</p>
<p>So I'm already defining a small protocol in my mind which might be quite nice.</p>
<p>There are 4 corners of an image so maybe something like this:</p>
<ul><li>Top Left: <a href="/">Photographer's Homepage</a></li><li>Top Right: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andychilton">Photographer's Photo Page</a></li><li>Bottom Left: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andychilton/2252890427/">Image Page</a></li><li>Bottom Right: nothing (as yet)</li></ul>
<p>Any thoughts (apart from the fact it might look ugly)?
