<p>Over the past few weeks, I've been reading a few blogs about writing. Mainly they're designed for people writing blogs but these guys also write for magazines, newspapers and other places too.</p>
<p>So far, I've been really enjoying exploring two sites in particular:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">http://www.copyblogger.com/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.problogger.net/">http://www.problogger.net/</a></li></ul>
<p>Once I start reading an article on CopyBlogger I end up doing the <a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">Wikipedia thing</a>. I find myself with 7 or 8 tabs open with them all still to read.</p>
<p>Hopefully my writing style is improving and I'm really happy with my latest entry on Retire at 40, titled <a href="http://retire-at-40.blogspot.com/2008/10/one-technique-on-how-to-start-saving.html">One Technique on How to Start Saving</a>.</p>
<p>I'd seriously recommend subscribing to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">CopyBlogger</a> and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">ProBlogger</a> also has fantastic articles.
