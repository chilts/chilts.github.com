<p>By a massive 3 weeks!</p>
<p>I always thought NZ summers were short - and not just 'coz of the weather!</p>
<p>Article at Stuff: <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4043386a10.html">Daylight saving extended by three weeks</a>.</p>
<p>I'm glad it came forward a week, but putting the end of summer back by 2 weeks is great. Now, instead of artificially cutting the summer short - especially because it's still nice in March - we get the daylight for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Am happy with that!</p>
<p>P.S. My speaker system keeps on putting the volume up and down whenever it likes. Maybe I have a poltergeist.
