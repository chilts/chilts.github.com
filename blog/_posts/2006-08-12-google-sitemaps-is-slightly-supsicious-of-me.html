<p>I submitted a sitemap to Google Sitemaps and confirmed that I owned the site. But wait, what's this obscure request...</p>
<p>To try out <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login">Google Sitemaps</a>, I firstly had to prove that I was the owner of this site. They gave me a URL of the form <code>http://kapiti.geek.nz/google################.html</code> where each <code>#</code> was a number or letter.</p>
<p>A while after I put the page on the site and Google had verified it, I looked in the server logs to see at what time it had been requested. Immediately after the page was requested, another request for the page <code>http://kapiti.geek.nz/noexist_################.html</code> was also there, which obviously gave a 404.</p>
<p>I think they are being slightly suspicious of servers which return a page for any URL requested which I guess is what the <code>noexist</code> request is to stop. Anyway, that kinda made me smile thinking that my server was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>As for the Sitemap itself, well I used the Perl Module <a href="http://minixml.psychogenic.com/">XML::Mini</a> which is quite nice in a funny way. I thought that this Google Sitemap Generator would be good for a module, so I looked on <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> - lo and behold, there already is one by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Google%3A%3ASiteMap&amp;mode=module">Jason Kohles</a>.</p>
<p>Ah well (but that's a good thing).
