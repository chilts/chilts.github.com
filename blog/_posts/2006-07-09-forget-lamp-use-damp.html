title: Forget about LAMP, why not try DAMP!

<p>Now that kapiti.geek.nz is a living breathing thing, I thought I'd offer you
my thoughts on the technologies being used to run the thing.</p>
<p>There are many different packages being used to help with the site, but
there are five main projects of major use here.</p>
<p>The site is run on a Debian Sarge box, the webserver is Apache, the pages
are written in Perl using Mason and PostgreSQL is the backend database. I
have become quite accustomed to using each of these and the main thing for
me is that each of them is the best at what they do. Collectively, I think
they're even better.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is my opinion and you are welcome to offer your own
alternatives. This is my alternative and I like it.</p>
<p>For this, I offer you a new accronym. Forget LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
PHP). I'm using <strong>DAMP</strong>:</p>
<pre> D - Debian
 A - Apache
 M - Mason
 P - PostgreSQL</pre>
<p>(Of course, Mason implies Perl).</p>
<p>So next time someone asks if you're using LAMP, reply &quot;Nope, I'm using
<strong>DAMP</strong>.&quot;</p>
