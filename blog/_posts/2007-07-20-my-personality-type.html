<p>What type of personality are you on the Myers-Briggs test?</p>
<p>On Kerryn's blog, she posted that she had done a <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/2007/07/personalities.html">personality test</a> and showed us the results.</p>
<p>I went and <a href="http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html">took the test too</a>. In reality, it tells you only what you tell it, but it's funny how it fills in a few gaps and you think '<em>that's so me</em>'.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you a little story. You have to answer 4 questions and each has two answers. I noticed at the top that it is considered that there are 16 personality types. So yeah, 2^4 is 16.</p>
<p>I finished answering them. I knew the answers to Q's 1, 3 and 4 straight away but I wasn't sure about Q2. I answered it as best I could and found out my result. I'm of type <strong>ISTP</strong>, which is a <strong>Dominant Introverted Thinking</strong>. You can read what it says about <a href="http://www.personalitypathways.com/dom-ti.html">me as an ISTP</a> here.</p>
<p>Now, this is where I hit a problem with the page - it only gives you 8 explanations - but whoa, you said there were 16! I, as an <strong>ISTP</strong>, is lumped in with <strong>INTP</strong>, and yes, that happens to be Question 2 so obviously those personalities are quite close to each other.</p>
<p>In my quest for finding things out, there was another link to another page of explanations of <a href="http://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/type-descriptions.htm">The Sixteen Types at a Glance</a>. It turns out that after reading both <strong>ISTP</strong> and <strong>INTP</strong> that I am more like the former than the latter - which was my answer to the original question.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll just point out a few sentences from some of the descriptions I found to be quite interesting:</p>
<ul><li>They distrust action taken too quickly without the necessary investigation.</li><li>They are fiercely independent, seeking input and comments from a chosen few.</li><li>When reporting to others, they need to establish credibility first: their own and that of the person they are reporting to.</li><li>They are less interested in running the world as they are in understanding it.</li><li>They may spend a lot of time defining words, concepts and systems in order to define a problematic solution.</li><li>Although they do have a spontaneous, even playful side, what people often first encounter with them is their detached pragmatism.</li></ul>
<p>So yeah, a perfect fit for a programmer I think. I particularly liked point 2, the second half of which is exactly what I was talking to Kerryn about yesterday. Very strange.
