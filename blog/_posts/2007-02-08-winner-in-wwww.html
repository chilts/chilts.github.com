<p>KiwiWriters.org has just finished it's first site-wide challenge, the wwwW - Waitangi Weekend Word Wace.</p>
<p>And here is my icon to prove it :-)</p>
<p class="c"><img src="/s/icons/wwww-winner-120x90.png" title="wwwW Winner" /></p>
<p>The idea of <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/wwww/">wwwW</a> is to write a short story of 7,500 words in just four days over Waitangi Weekend.</p>
<p>It was a lot harder than I thought it would be and I think this is for two reasons. In comparison to NaNoWriMo, because you only have four days, it's a <em>huge</em> amount harder to catch up if you fall behind - a trap a few of us got caught out by.</p>
<p>But the other reason is also because, instead of writing to 'fill out' the novel (as you <em>have</em> to doing NaNoWriMo), you can't pad as much - you have to keep the story rolling and every scene has to count. This means you have to think more about it. I might make the suggestion that we spread it over a little more time next year, dunno yet.</p>
<p>Finally, to tell you a little about what happened, I actually got to 6,002 words with the story and then killed it off. It was about fighting and blood and stuff like that, stuff I really don't like reading about let alone writing. In the end, I started a new story which was about toys, kids, sprouts, cabbage, Star Wars and Transformers. It was much easier to write and a lot funnier. I managed 1,600 words in not much over an hour. Prior to that, I was managing maybe 500 words an hour which isn't very good.</p>
<p>Just proves that you should write about what you like.</p>
