<p>And the weird thing is, it hasn't even started yet!</p>
<p>Currently, we stand at:</p>
<ul><li>27 participants (which is 8 more than NaNoWriMo's first year)</li><li>2 special word count widgets</li><li>2 flyers (<a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/s/banners/SoCNoC-2007-Flyer-NZ.pdf">NZ</a> and <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/s/banners/SoCNoC-2007-Flyer-General.pdf">General</a> - so please, put them up in your school, your work, your place</li><li>lots of other stuff</li><li>and one more thing coming tomorrow I can't yet tell you about</li></ul>
<p>Once all this organisation, code development and general work for the site has been put aside on 31st May, I'll actually be able to write the novel!</p>
<p>It's going to be so cool.
