<p>After finding out about Google Code today, I decided to put one of my
projects on there - Phliky.</p>
<p>So far, it's going well. I've created the project
(\[p]{Phliky|http://code.google.com/p/phliky/}) and organised my repository.
In true Google style, it has a very clear interface and is also easy to
navigate.</p>
<p>Saying that, the interface is quite sparse at the moment though, but I think
that it will be filled out as time goes on. As an example, when you click
'Settings' in the top right corner (to change your Subversion password),
there are no links to get back to the 'Project Home' and the other 3 main
tabbed pages.</p>
<p>There is an \[p]{Issue Tracker|http://code.google.com/p/phliky/issues/list}
and they do mention in the \[p]{FAQ|http://code.google.com/hosting/faq.html}
that they created it to be minimal but configurable. Looking at the
configuration for the Issue Tracker, it makes perfect sense that you can add
your own Open and Closed Status values and Issue Labels (which I guess is
the same as tagging an entry). This way, you can make the tracker work
exactly how you work, though they do already provide a decent set of
defaults.</p>
<p>One great thing about \[p]{browsing the
repository|http://phliky.googlecode.com/svn/} is that, as soon as you have
commited a check-in, it is already updated with the latest Subversion
Revision - no waiting round for the web accessible source to update.</p>
<p>One slight problem I had with the repository though was when I checked it
out using the URL I found, I didn't realise that it was already the trunk -
serves me right for not looking close enough. I'm used to checking out the
whole repository - trunk, branches, tags and all - so I ended up making
<code>trunk/</code> (again), <code>branches/</code> (again) and <code>tags/</code> (again)! Bugger. A bit
of tidy-up later and I was good - am so glad it uses Subversion as opposed to CVS.</p>
<p>Overall then, I'm quote impressed and think that I'll like it even more in
the future.</p>
