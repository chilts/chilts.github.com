<p>Seeing as I had only written 1,283 words so far this month, I will have to make an extra special effort to get this novel out this month.</p>
<p>I have though, made it even harder than that since I have thrown those already written words away and started again. From scratch. With nothing.</p>
<p>This might sound like madness but in fact I'm a big fan of symmetry and round numbers. It turns out, this being the 11th that there were 20 more days left in the month including today.</p>
<p>Of those, 14 are weekdays and 6 are the weekend. Therefore to get 50,000 words I have to write 2,000 words/day each weekday and 4,000 words/day at the weekends.</p>
<p>I don't know about you but those numbers appeal to me and I actually feel better for doing it. Don't ask me why because if you did I'd just reply &quot;Because that's how my brain works!&quot;</p>
<p>This word count is totally do-able and it'll take outside influences and factors to stop me achieving it, much like they have been stopping me so far this month.</p>
<p>Wish me luck and I'll see you again at the end of June.
