<p>It seems that I can't think about anything else at the moment.</p>
<p>Take tonight for instance. I was meant to go out from work with a mate for a few drinks. But really, the whole day, I just wanted to come home and write!</p>
<p>I had a good day on Sunday, on Monday I found it hard since I was tired (just did 1,000 words), but tonight I was rearing to go.</p>
<p>And go I did. Again, I've had a good one and managing over 3,000 words has really pushed me back to believing I can actually do this - my expected average of the rest of the days is now under 2,000 at 1,934.</p>
<p>The best thing is though, my novel is getting exciting (hey, this is all from <em>my</em> point of view, so back off).</p>
<p>As I said at the start of the month, I am <strong>way</strong> out of my comfort zone here, I can't write, my English isn't great anyway but I don't care. I just want to finish this.</p>
<p>For the statisticians amongst you, I'm currently on 19,045 words, which means that I have hit over 101,000 characters on this here keyboard :-)
