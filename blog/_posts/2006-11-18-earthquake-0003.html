<p>At 2006-11-18 03:38.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I actually woke up when it happened or if I was awake anyway, but this one certainly felt like a big one. I looked at my alarm clock and I remember it showing 03:37, so it must be slightly slow (used to be fine until the power cut last week).</p>
<p>Looking at the Geonet report, it says it was a 5.5 magnitude about 40km south-west of Kapiti which is a pretty big one really and way closer than the previous two I have reported here.</p>
