<p>Just a short announcement to say that v0.03 of <a href="/project/lollysite/">Lollysite</a> has been released.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/project/lollysite/releases.html">releases</a> page for more info.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/lollysite/">Lollysite now has an Ohloh</a> page. From here you can also <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/lollysite/download?package=Lollysite">download all the previous releases</a> too.</p>
<p>Of course, there is always the <a href="http://gitorious.org/lollysite/">source code repository</a> on <a href="http://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</a> too.</p>
<h2>For the Future</h2>
<p>For v0.04, I have penned in a number of features such as:</p>
<pre> 3f656b91   Finished     Make site feed at top level
 65d73568   New          Add new section layouts - Featured Node (or equivalent)
 96d842e8   New          Serve file uploads (or any node with data) from it's own section
 a4c0e80f   New          Add a 'FlickrImage' node type
 ac70e68c   New          Add new ways to render each node
 cf3a93db   New          Make the section and node edit screens present all the attributes to the user
 dfb824e5   InProgress   Make images (files, etc) assets rather than nodes</pre>
<p>So, having three releases in two weeks has been a lot of fun (release early, release often) though I suspect v0.04 will be a couple of weeks away. Christmas/New Year and complexity will make it a bit further out. Also, I'm going to use the new <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/12/app-engine-sdk-130-released-including.html">BlobStore</a> API. All good fun :)</p>
<p>(Ends)
