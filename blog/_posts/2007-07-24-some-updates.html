<p>About Welly and Coding.</p>
<p>I chilled at work drinks on Friday, met a few friends for coffee on Saturday and had a pot luck dinner that evening. Went to see <a href="http://www.wellingtonphoenix.com/">Wellington Phoenix</a> thrash Sydney FC 3-0 on Sunday and enjoyed sitting and watching a film in the evening for the first time in ages.</p>
<p>Also, I'm back into coding (lots) again. I did quite a bit in the last couple of weeks - not on Zaapt but on KiwiWriters - some major things including timezone support, member challenges and fixing up lots of other little things no-one really notices.</p>
<p>With some smaller improvements being done for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> I'm also adding a few things to Zaapt now too - in fact, I'm almost at the stage where I am re-factoring a few models and adding some new features rather than adding new models themselves. Maybe I'll reach version v0.1 one day. I still want to get some sort of photo gallery model in there first though. And Martyn has also suggested I put in roles for content-types too.</p>
<p>I should also write more documentation, as always.</p>
<p>Finally, I've also added <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phliky">Phliky</a> to Ohloh too (see <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6800">Phliky Page on Ohloh</a>). I also received and gave out some Kudos :-)</p>
<p>After this brain dump, I should hit the sack.
