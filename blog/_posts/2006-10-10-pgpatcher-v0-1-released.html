<p>After uploading the executables yesterday, it now has packaging and has the heady status of being release v0.1!</p>
<p>Working with Google Code has been a joy so far. Not only can I use Subversion but I have also been playing with all of their groups pages too.</p>
<p>PgPatcher now has a <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pgpatcher-discuss">pgpatcher-discuss</a> and <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/pgpatcher-commit">pgpatcher-commit</a> group each. Every time I commit, the latter group receives an email outlining which files have been changed.</p>
<p>Not only this, but for a different project, <a href="/software/phliky.html">Phliky</a>, in addition to the 'Discuss' and 'Commit' groups there is a new 'Issue' group which gets notified everytime an issue is changed in the issue tracker. It has taken a while to set up all these things, but now it's all working, I'm happy.</p>
<p>I guess my next step is to create a debian repository for all these packages.
