<p>Every so often, the originality of the internet just amazes me.</p>
<p>Recently, after I've watched a film on DVD, I have watched the trailers afterwards to see how they put them together. Each time I have been amazed at how many times they throw clips in there - completely out of context - to make the trailer more intense.</p>
<p>It always just seemed a little fake to me and also proves that you can't trust a trailer to guide you on how good or bad the final film will be.</p>
<p>As conclusive proof, I just stumbled across a competition run in 2005 - as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7325280.stm">BBC News reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In 2005, a film-making body in New York issued a challenge to America's assistant film editors - take an existing movie trailer, and re-edit it in an entirely different genre.</blockquote>
<p>I have just watched three trailers which were entered into the competition and they're all hilarious. See for yourself:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uwuLxrv8jY">Brokeback to the Future</a></li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkVWuP_sO0">Shining</a></li></ul>
<p>and my personal favourite:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP-dOcl9NIE">Good Will Hunted</a></li></ul>
<p>As I said, proof you can't trust the trailer and further proof that the internet is a funny place.
