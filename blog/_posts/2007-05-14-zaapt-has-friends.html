<p>Recently I've updated Zaapt to allow member to add other members to their friends list. It's a good base for some fairly interesting forthcoming developments.</p>
<p>So even though having friends doesn't mean much, it's what you do with them that counts! Isn't that just life in general.</p>
<p>On that point, I had a great weekend seeing people. On each of Friday, Saturday and Sunday I met up with a number of groups of friends, listened to Wellington Brass Band, had food and drink, went to the NZSO and had a walk in <a href="http://www.otariwiltonsbush.org.nz/">Otari - Wilton's Bush</a>. All highly enjoyable and very lovely. Especially in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Summer">Indian Summer</a> we're having.
