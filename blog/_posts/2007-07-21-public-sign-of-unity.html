<p>As a public sign of Unity, I shall be linking from this blog entry to the official OpenID community site.</p>
<p>Here are some details about a nasty bit of <a href="http://kveton.com/blog/2007/07/19/much-ado-about-org/">URL exploitation</a> which is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>As a public show of unity, I shall link to the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Community Site</a> and not the one doing the exploitation. I did consider linking to the openid.net site using the words <em>openid</em> and <em>org</em> but I fear that's as bad as the original exploitation, so I shall refrain from it.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do require an OpenID, I would wholeheartedly recommended <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">MyOpenID</a> which has also been improved recently to show a log of your recent activities. I can recommend this because it's the one I use.</p>
<p>If you want to research this yourself, take a look at the <a href="http://openid.net/wiki/index.php/OpenIDServers">OpenID Providers</a> on this list.
