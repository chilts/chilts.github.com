<p>Tonight, we got a good opportunity to hear and see what Mike Culver (Web Services Evangelist) had to say about Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>It was a good talk. A bit fast to go through everything but that's a reflection of how much <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon have to offer</a>. Lucky for me, I knew most of it but I did learn a few things along the way. Especially from the demo of using EC2. I wish he could have spoken more about SimpleDB though.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my plan to ask if I can be added to the Beta program for SimpleDB worked and I have just sent an email off asking if I can join it. So yeah, that makes me very happy.</p>
<p>The good thing is, as you know, I've been playing with S3 and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/s3bak/">s3bak</a> a lot recently, but I've also been making a program to play with EC2 as well. It's actually not that big but already there is some good functionality. My plan to make a small command line interface to both SimpleDB and SQS is also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>It certainly is exciting to be playing with these technologies and while there are some criticisms against them, I'd say to see them as they are and watch them advance over time. The whole point of the whole setup is to be easy to use and it's up to us application developers to use them in new and enlightened ways, adding value along the way.</p>
<p>However, I do see a different problem though - oh so many ideas and oh so little time.</p>

<p><strong>2008-02-20 19:32 - Update</strong>: Don Christie (president of NZOSS) has linked to this article from his <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/passthesource/">Pass the Source</a> blog - <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/passthesource/2008/02/20/when-amazon-comes-to-town/">When Amazon Comes to Town</a>.  Out of the 4 quotes of feedback, mine was the top one and one which I will try and expand into a bigger article later.
