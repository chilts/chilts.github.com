<p>I haven't written much about KiwiWriter's SoCNoC yet this year but I have two reasons why.</p>
<p>The first is that I've been out of action, both mentally (hard at work), physically (moving house) and electronically (a myriad of problems getting back online).</p>
<p>But the good thing is, I don't actually have to write much for SoCNoC this year because other people are doing it for us.</p>
<p>Here's a few examples:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://booklady.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/socnoc-and-winner/">SoCNoC and a Contest Winner</a> (<a href="http://booklady.wordpress.com/">The Book Lady</a>)</li><li><a href="http://saraste.blog.com/3088336/">SoCNoC blogging</a>     (<a href="http://saraste.blog.com/">Saraste</a>)</li><li><a href="http://featherling.blogspot.com/2008/05/sadistic-muses-and-un-normalness.html">Sadistic muses and un-normalness</a> (<a href="http://featherling.blogspot.com/">Griffin Asher</a>)</li><li><a href="http://subtlekissesinthedark.blogspot.com/2008/05/so-ive-got-rs-english-lit-and-bcs-out.html">SubtleKissesInTheDark</a></li><li><a href="http://speakcoffeetome.blogspot.com/2008/05/writing-guides-in-review.html ">Writing Guides in Review</a> (<a href="http://speakcoffeetome.blogspot.com/">SpeakCoffeeToMe</a>)</li><li><a href="http://rossthewriter.livejournal.com/722.html">New Beginnings</a> (<a href="http://rossthewriter.livejournal.com/">Ross the Writer</a>)</li><li><a href="http://glitterburn.livejournal.com/6611.html">SoCNoC approaches...</a> (<a href="http://glitterburn.livejournal.com/">autiotalo</a>)</li><li><a href="http://pamwritesromance.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/no-really-isnt-there-an-off-switch-or-something/">No, really-isn't there an off switch or something?</a> (<a href="http://pamwritesromance.wordpress.com/">Pam Writes Romance</a>)</li></ul>
<p>...but the best site goes to redfox for a dedicated mini-site:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/sarahbracey/RedFox/SoCNoC/SoCNoC.html">SoCNoC</a></li></ul>
<p>You also know when things are taking off when people out there start making things for your site you just didn't expect :-)</p>
<p>In the real life side of things, we had write-ins in Wellington last year but this year we expect to have write-ins in Wellington, Dunedin and Palmerston North, as well as a NZ on-line kick-off party and an American one too :-)</p>
<p>For the techies and the stats people. May has already been a quite fantastic month. We have:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2008.html">87 participants</a></li><li>gotten over 20,000 hits on the site this month</li><li>had over 2,000 visitors</li><li>and gained over 120 new sign-ups</li></ul>
<p>So far, it's going really well but hopefully June is going to be even better.</p>
<p>So if you're still pondering whether to write your first novel, why not just <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">sign up</a> anyway, <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2008.html">accept the challenge</a> and see what happens. You'll probably be surprised at what you can do :-)
