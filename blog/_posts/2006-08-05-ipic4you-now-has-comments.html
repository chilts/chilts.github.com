<p>After releasing iPic4You to my family last week, I added the ability to
comment on each other's photos - it's gone down a storm</p>
<p>I didn't realise what a difference it would make - but it does. This is
especially true because all the people using it know each other which means
that the comments actually make sense!</p>
<p>Already I can see the comments turning it from a nice photo gallery, to
something a whole hell of a lot more personal - which was the plan in the
first place.</p>
<p>Also, it's getting funny already :-)</p>
