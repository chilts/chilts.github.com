<p>This week has, again, been fairly busy. Not just in social but other stuff too.</p>
<p>I really should be doing my <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/the-end-is-nigh-2007.html">The End is Nigh</a> this month, but instead I keep finding geek things to do.</p>
<p>Firstly, earlier on in the month I <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/news/7.html (deprecated) implemented a new gallery</strong> content type in Zaapt. Then I rebranded and ported this site to Zaapt too.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I'm in at the start of a whole new adventure regarding <strong>Open Standards</strong> which is also related to <strong>Social Networks</strong>. No, I'm not talking about the <a href="http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/">Social Graph</a> everyone is talking about, but just another little corner of the web which should be a little more open for everyone concerned. I alluded to this new project in a post last week but it's starting to get some momentum already.</p>
<p>No details to be posted as yet but rest assured, they'll be coming fairly soon.</p>
<p>I have found recently that I really enjoy the content management side of things, not only because of Zaapt but because of the fact that all the data generated for the site is by human beings.</p>
<p>On three previous work projects I've been on, most of the data was generated by computers or instruments attached to them, so it's good to realise what actually makes me tick. Added to this my recent interest in OpenID there are a number of things all pointing in one general direction for me at the moment, so that's good.
