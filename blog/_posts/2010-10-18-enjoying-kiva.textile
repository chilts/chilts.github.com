Just thought I'd post a short entry saying how much I am enjoying microloaning on "Kiva":http://www.kiva.org/.

"Chris":http://www.kiva.org/lender/ranginui told me about Kiva a couple of years ago and I have seen "Brenda and Callum":http://www.kiva.org/lender/Shiny and "Bruce":http://www.kiva.org/lender/bwooce (all in Wgtn) on Kiva too. ("My profile.":http://www.kiva.org/lender/chilts)

By the way, if you want to join up then give me a shout and I'll invite you (I'll need your email address). You can just go and sign up yourself, but at the moment if I get 5 invitees and they make a successful loan each, then I'll get an extra $25 to be able to loan out :)

Am up to 15 loans now (Kiva Avg = 6.4) and it seems that every month I get some money back, put a little more in and then make another loan or two.

* Update1: forgot to mention that I'm a part of the "KivaKiwis":http://www.kiva.org/team/kivakiwis and "Koha":http://www.kiva.org/team/koha teams
* Update2: sent out one invite to a friend.
* Update3: to get the $25 I need the 5 invitees to make at least one loan each before the end of October
