<p>After a short while playing with kapiti.geek.nz, I've pretty much done all the admin interface now.</p>
<p>You might have noticed over the week or so, I have done two main things: (1) I broke the posting of comments on the blog entries, and (2) I added a random quote to the top right.</p>
<p>Well, I've fixed the first and am now using the new admin interface to manipulate the blog and its entries. I also have an admin section for the quotes and for the (RSN) content managed pages.</p>
<p>I'm doing it all in such a way that if I want to re-use all these modules in a future project, I can and do so quite easily. This site is a <a href="forget-lamp-use-damp.html">DAMP</a> site (of course), and after a while playing with different websites, I know what I want, how to do it and most of all, be consistent in my approach. This way future additions are easier.</p>
<p>At first, I wanted the administration to allow many users, with different roles and access permissions, but there are many \[p]{CMS tools|http://www.cmsmatrix.org/} out there which do all this - and they are huge, both in function and form.</p>
<p>My plan is to make something a <strong>lot</strong> smaller and allow any user to change anything. This means there will be the abilty for many people to log in, but no access rights or roles need to be assumed - everyone has the power to do anything. It will be ideal for personal sites and for small to medium businesses. Even so, I have ideas about how it <em>could</em> expand to fill in all these things, but I'm trying to repell them since that will ruin the overall plan - to keep it small.</p>
<p>Eventually, I will get everything together and release it on this page, but not until I have a few different content types and a consistent approach. There are other things on the way but I won't promise too much for the future. </p>
<p>Look out though for some recipe pages over the next week or so :-)
