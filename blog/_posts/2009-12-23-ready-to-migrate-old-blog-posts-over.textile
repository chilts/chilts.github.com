A recent "commit on Lollysite":http://gitorious.org/lollysite/lollysite/commit/a45cdf15a03943b70ca7fc9675a00811ef4f707a has enabled me to import old blog posts from my other sites. Yep, you heard right, I'm going to concentrate all my blogging prowess here.

This includes my old entries from:

* *http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/ (deprecated) kapiti.geek.nz*
* *http://www.retire-at-40.com/blog/ (deprecated) Retire at 40*
* *http://pie.geek.nz/blog/ (deprecated) pie.geek.nz*
* some posts and articles from a couple of other sites too

I hope that once the migrations are done, and I redirect the traffic from those sites here, I'll be more consistently posting. Also, I'm reaching the stage where I'm understanding AppEngine a little more and actually have less things to do for "Lollysite":/project/lollysite/ now.

BTW, I'm now also writing my blog entries in "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ instead of my proprietary (but open source) wiki markup "Phliky":http://github.com/chilts/phliky

It's very nice. Finally, I find a wiki-type markup language I like.
