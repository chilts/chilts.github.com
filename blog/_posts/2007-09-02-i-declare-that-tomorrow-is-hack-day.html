<p>I believe the weather is going to be bad tomorrow, so I now pronounce it hack day.</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn't matter about the weather at all. There are just some things I need to get done. I wasn't going to write a list of things I had to do because then I'd be bound by it, but that's probably a good thing and then I'll see how well I did.</p>
<p>Okay, here goes:</p>
<ol><li>write the challenge progress cron for KiwiWriters so that we remember everyone's progress for every challenge</li><li>complete by changes to Zaapt for <a href="http://www.opendesigns.org/designs/703/">Role-Based Access Control</a></li><li>play with Google Maps more (see my <a href="/maps/">current play thing</a> (note: it only saves points locally in that page, so any additions you do, you'll <strong>lose</strong> - so just have a click and a play)</li></ol>
<p>I don't hope to do all those things, but I may get the first and some of the second done.
