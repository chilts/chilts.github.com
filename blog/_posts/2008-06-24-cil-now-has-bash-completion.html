<p>Another day, another feature added to cil. It's rocketing along.</p>
<p>I've never written anything for bash completion before (someone else has always done it for me) but I had a go at it tonight. After an hour and 15 I had it working quite well.</p>
<p>I was suitably impressed with the whole thing since even though I knew doing it for commands and/or options would be easy enough, I managed to do it for a few other things too (more later).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre> $ cil a&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
 add attach
 
 $ cil s&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
 show status summary
 
 $ cil --&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
 --filename --help --label --path --status --version</pre>
<p>That's all happy and nice but the following feature is the killer and will make working with issues a breeze. It also completes the actual issue/comment/attachment name, giving you the choice of the correct type where necessary.</p>
<p>Let's say your <code>issues/</code> dir contains three issues, two comments and one attachment:</p>
<pre> $ ls -1 issues/*.cil
 issues/a_85eceee9.cil
 issues/c_d8dd779f.cil
 issues/c_feb65ae7.cil
 issues/i_02ee35bd.cil
 issues/i_5c88cb30.cil
 issues/i_98203ce8.cil</pre>
<p>When doing the following, it completes to one of the three issue names:</p>
<pre> $ cil show &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
 02ee35bd 5c88cb30 98203ce8</pre>
<p>as it also does for the other commands that act on issues (status, edit, comment and attach).</p>
<p>Another example would be for extracting attachments:</p>
<pre> $ cil extract &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</pre>
<p>completes to:</p>
<pre> $ cil extract 85eceee9</pre>
<p>This is pretty good stuff already but I can already see that it can be used a lot more in the future...</p>
<p>Let's say you allow the following statusus in your issues: <strong>New</strong>, <strong>InProgress</strong>, <strong>Finished</strong> and <strong>WontFix</strong>. Then, setting the status of an issue would work like:</p>
<pre> $ cil status 02ee35bd &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
 InProgress Finished New WontFix</pre>
<p>Really straightforward and really fast, which are basically two of the things I wanted cil to be from the start - I just didn't realise it would be so easy :-)</p>
<p>Seeing as I try and credit people where I can, thanks to <a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/">Francois</a> for the suggestion of adding bash completion. It's given me a chance to learn something new to me but very powerful.</p>
<p>Note: this feature is in Git and will be in the v0.3.0 release.
