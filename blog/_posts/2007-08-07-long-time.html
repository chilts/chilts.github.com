<p>Haven't written here for a while, so a quick update from last week.</p>
<p>Things have been good:</p>
<ul><li>I've started the Gallery plugin for <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong>, almost done (oh, alright then, 40% done)</li><li><a href="http://www.gamma.net.nz/">Don</a> is looking at installing and using Zaapt, which will be big news since that'll be the first install I'm not in charge of</li><li>I've been to Rock'n'Roll again with <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a>, always a good laugh</li><li>spoke to my brother on the phone and gave him instructions to download <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>, install it, use it and reject the evil ways of <em>Internet Exploder</em></li><li>caught up with <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a> and the others</li><li>started unf*cking the mess in the garage, in some cases 4 years worth of crap - I'm sorting it out and throwing it out</li></ul>
<p>As always, it's been a busy week. Bumped into <a href="http://archaelus.livejournal.com/">nem</a> on Sunday and we were just saying how we both like Wellington. It seems to be popular at the moment, with  <a href="http://she.geek.nz/archives/457-wellington-is-slowly-growing-on-me-again.html">Penny Pants</a> saying similar things, as I have done <a href="busy-weekend.html">here</a> and <a href="happiness-is-a-cigar-called-hamlet.html">here</a> recently.</p>
<p>The one thing I'm not doing is starting to finish off those things I've promised for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/the-end-is-nigh-2007.html">The End is Nigh</a> challenge at <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">Kiwi Writers</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, all in all, a good week but busy.
