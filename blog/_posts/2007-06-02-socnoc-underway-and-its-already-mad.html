<p>Just a short post to say hi and that SoCNoC is going mad.</p>
<p>In just two days we have had:</p>
<ul><li>an explosion of people, now 80 people signed up to the site</li><li>50 people signed up to the challenge</li><li>we have already passed a collective 50,000 words</li><li>a new blog on KiwiWriters.org, called the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/news/klog/">Klog</a></li></ul>
<p>And last but not least:</p>
<ul><li>there is an interview with a member (<a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/u/madscientist.html">madscientist</a> aka <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fireflylegacy/">Lesley J. Collins</a>) in the Tribune (in Palmerston North) on Sunday</li></ul>
<p>It's going completely mad at the moment and I'm sure it'll get madder as the month goes on.
