<p>SuperHappyDevHouse originated as a monthly hackathon in San Francisco and thanks to a few people here in Wellington, it is now starting over here too!</p>
<p>There's been quite an overwhelming response to go to it I hear. Both <a href="http://she.geek.nz/">Penny</a> and <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> are 2 of the 4 organisers and you know what, it sounds like it's going to be <strong>oarsum</strong> (with a capital OAR).</p>
<p>So, I was one of the privileged few that scored an invite for the first event (yay me) but I can't go (which sucks big time).</p>
<p>Then again, I can't be too sad since I'm seeing family for the weekend and it might be the last time I see them for a year or two and even then it'll be sparse.</p>
<p>Still wish I could go though. Some expletives were said when I realised it was the same weekend. And I saw a preview of the T-Shirts today, which are also oarsum.</p>
<p>So sorry Penny and Brenda - will definitely get to the next one.
