<p>Glyn Moody has just written an article on why Skype should be open sourced.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/why-ebay-should-open-source-skype">Why eBay Should Open-Source Skype</a> is an interesting read. Whilst I think open-sourcing Skype would be good, it would be hard to convince eBay to do it. So Glyn's views that everyone should get behind an open source version of it doesn't get a look in until it <em>actually</em> is open sourced.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html#skypereplacement">FSF's list of High Priority Free Software Projects</a> should be looked at and considered the best approach at this time.</p>
<p>Yes, an open source version of Skype will win but if that doesn't happen, getting behing Ekiga and the other open source VOIP programs and open VOIP protocols is the best thing to do at the moment.
