<p>Using Postgres when working with different timezones is great. Here's a
small tip to help.</p>
<p>I was wondering today if there was a way to tell Postgres to default to a
particular time zone when setting or retrieving 'timestamp with time zone'
types. Using the <code>SET...</code> command seemed the way (at first), but after a
quick look at the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/datatype-datetime.html">Postgres documentation</a>,
the <code>PGTZ</code> environment variable can be used to automatically set the
default timezone upon connection.</p>
<p>Then Martyn (in work) made a good suggestion which was to set the variable
in the Apache configuration. So I did...</p>
<p>...except it didn't work - at first.</p>
<p>I tried setting it to one of <code>NZST</code>, <code>CEST</code> and <code>UTC</code>, though only the
latter worked. After reading a bit more and playing with <code>tzselect</code>, I
tried setting it to <code>Europe/London</code> and <code>Pacific/Auckland</code> it worked
perfectly. It seems to be very system dependent.</p>
<p>Once figured out, Postgres makes it all so easy. :-)</p>
