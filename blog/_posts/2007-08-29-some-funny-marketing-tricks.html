<p>I received an email from Genesis Energy today. I never asked for it and (in all honesty) I can't remember the last one they sent.</p>
<pre>
&quot; Andrew, put your hands up before time's up!</pre>
<blockquote>We emailed you recently about the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act, which comes into force in September 2007. That means if you want to receive occasional Genesis Energy news, offers and information the environmentally friendly way, you need to give us your consent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We haven’t received it yet, so here’s a reminder to give your consent before
Friday 31 August 2007 if you want your chance in the draw to win one of
six prizes of $1,000*!</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. Getting you to consent to getting spam by spamming people. I haven't given my consent yet and not likely too either.</p>
<p>This reminds me of when the AA sent me a letter saying I should get <em>Life Insurance</em> with them. They sent me a second and a third letter. The third time I phoned their 0800 number and the conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;Hi, I'm just phoning about the letter you sent me regarding Life Insurance.&quot; I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Oh yeah, how may I help?&quot; she said in a chirpy voice, hoping to get a sale.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Erm, can you stop sending me them please.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Oh okay.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Or how about when Vodafone phoned me up to <em>'ask me some questions'</em>. Towards the end they pretty much stated that I didn't use the phone much.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;No, not much,&quot; I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Would you consider upgrading your plan?&quot;</blockquote>
<p>WTF? I just said I didn't use the phone much.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;Er, no thanks.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Okay. Would you recommend Vodafone to your friends and family?&quot; she asked politely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;No.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Oh really&quot; she sounded surprised (<strong>YA RLY</strong> I thought). &quot;Is there anything we can do that would change your mind?&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Yep,&quot; I replied &quot;it's quite simple. Give us more, for less.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Oh, okay. I'll er, put that in.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;KTHXBAI&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Nothing has changed yet. It's still a rip-off. I can but hope. Funny though :-)
