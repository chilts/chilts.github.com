<p>This writing thing is beginning to get bigger in my life.</p>
<p>So here's the deal:</p>
<ul><li>I've always written a diary when I've been travelling</li><li>at one stage over a few years, I wrote down <em>all</em> of my dreams (six in one night once)</li><li>I wrote a personal diary for a year and a half a few years ago</li><li>I've had an idea for a film screenplay for a long time</li><li>and for a couple of sit-coms</li><li>this blog started back in August</li><li>I've just done NaNoWriMo</li></ul>
<p>My life is taking a turn I never expected. Looking at it, I've always written things down, but it seems the writing thing is getting bigger and bigger. I would never have guessed.</p>
<p>Although I probably won't specialise in anything; fiction or fact, novels, screenplays or blogs, other random things I want to write about, I'll probably end up just doing whatever makes me happy at that time. Maybe it is just the act of writing rather than the subject matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, to continue my newly found hobby there are a few things floating on the horizon - three to be exact:</p>
<p>The first one is that I'll be doing <a href="http://x365.org/">x365.org</a> from my birthday onwards later this year.</p>
<p>The second isn't secret but a few of us here in Wellington are possibly going to put a little something together - to be announced in due course.</p>
<p>The third is a secret and I will let it out of the bag when it is complete :-)
