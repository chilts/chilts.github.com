<p>KiwiWriters is going from strength to strength. We now have a number of people who have joined up, an active forum section, lots of resource links and a new interview section.</p>
<p>Following a great interview of <a href="http://loveinatent.blogspot.com/">Michelle Waitzman</a> by <a href="http://cottreaureviews.blogspot.com/">Travis</a>, we now have the start of an interview section, which I think is a great stepping stone in furthering <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org">Kiwi Writers</a> development.</p>
<p>Also, I have a couple of new features in the pipeline which need to be finished off.</p>
<p>One is a new section which is specific to KiwiWriters and the other is something which will be added to the Forums. In both cases, they will test <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Zaapt</a>'s capabilities further and make sure I'm still on the right track.
