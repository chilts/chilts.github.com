<p>Cil has been through Debian Unstable and is now in Debian Testing.</p>
<p>If you didn't know, <a href="/software/cil.html">Cil</a> is a command-line issue list which lends itself well to distributed bug tracking. It saves issues, comments and attachments locally and already there are some powerful features and ideas in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://packages.debian.org/lenny/cil">Cil v0.5.1</a> is now in testing and hopefully will be in the <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/">Lenny</a> release. That particular version of Cil has all of the basic structure required to start using it and a number of great commands to help use it.</p>
<p>There is no v0.6 of Cil yet but there are a number of things planned. I added some initial abstractions about how Cil can integrate with various VCS systems and <a href="http://sam.vilain.net/">SamV</a> has gone one step further and added some actual features which integrate even more to what I initial imagined. v0.6 will hope to tie up and pull together a number of loose ends around this whole area.</p>
<p>Further out, there are even more ideas on the horizon but I shall tell you about those closer to the time.</p>
<p>Some of you know I shall be off on my hols shortly so it may have to wait until after that but as I said, v0.5.1 is a nicely round and complete version to appear in Lenny. Have fun and happy hacking.
