<p>Exciting news for people who comment on Blogger blogs. They're now accepting OpenID on BloggerInDraft so soon enough it'll be phased into the rest of Blogger.</p>
<p>So on their post announcing that <a href="http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-feature-openid-commenting.html">Blogger will accept comments using OpenID</a> I decided to leave a comment there using my own identity.</p>
<p>And it worked - beautifully. It even asked my OpenID Provider some other details such as my name. I allowed them to do this and sure enough, my name 
appeared with the link to my site. So that's pretty cool too (I only typed my site url).</p>
<p>Anyway, I got number nine in the comment list.</p>
<p>So now, that means both <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> both accept OpenID for comments. I reckon that must mean that a large majority of blogs on this planet now accept OpenID - so let's now get <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a> to do it too.
