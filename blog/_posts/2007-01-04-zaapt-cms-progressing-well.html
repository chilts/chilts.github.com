<p>As stated in an earlier post, my ambitions for a simple but powerful CMS is progressing well.</p>
<p>I have added various content including Accounts (partial), Content Pages, FAQs and Blogs (partial). Planned content types to be added soon includes News, Forums, Links and Menus. I'm sure others will be added as it all progresses. Also, there is provision for sites to add their own content types on top of the boxed content types.</p>
<p>Progress is going well though of course it is still in the early stages of development. Even though I am taking the traditional route at the moment, there are plans to add shiny new Ajax to make things even nicer.</p>
<p>Finally, the project code can be found at Google Code under the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Zaapt</a> project. See the <a href="/software/zaapt.html">Zaapt</a> home page for the commit, issue and discuss groups...though these are quiet at the moment that's fine by me while I carry on.
