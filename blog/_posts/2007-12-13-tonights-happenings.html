<p>Gathering interest for next April and June.</p>
<p>It's amazing how many people are already expressing an interest for <a href="http://scriptfrenzy.org/">Script Frenzy</a> next April (for which I hope to be ML) and for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/socnoc/">SoCNoC</a> next June.</p>
<p>Tonight was <a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst</a>'s Christmas function at <a href="http://www.wellingtonzoo.com/">Wellington Zoo</a> and I had a number of people come up to me and express an interest in both of the above events. It's awesome to see that some of my enthusiasm for writing is rubbing off on other people. Not that it needed much rubbing off since most of them had thought about writing many years ago - it just so happens that this just gives them a little kick to give it another go.</p>
<p>And as a final note, many thanks to all the organisers of this year's Zoo Doo, it was the best of my four so far. Thanks Pauline, Vicky, the directors and everyone at Catalyst who made it happen. It was awesome.
