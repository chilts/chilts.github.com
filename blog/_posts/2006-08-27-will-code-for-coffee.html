<p>After 3 days without a good coffee, I'm in need of one. I'll even code...</p>
<p>After 3 days without a good coffee, I need to take desparate measures. I may code, if necessary.</p>
<p>Wellington airport gave me a good coffee from Fuel.</p>
<p>Sydney airport gave me something I'd expect on the flight itself. I tried it, and tried it again, then left the rest - it was not worth it.</p>
<p>Hong Kong airport forced me to go to Starbucks, which I didn't really want to do, but kinda had to. It was okay.</p>
<p>Since being in London, I wasn't in the situation to get one and on the way up to Liverpool, the motorway service station had them for the (converted) rate of $7 a pop. I declined buying one.</p>
<p>Hmmm, maybe I'll not get a good one for three weeks. Maybe this is the time to give up completely, as I have been thinking for a while - I drink too much.
