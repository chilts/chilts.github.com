<p>Over on KiwiWriters, we're doing a new type of challenge this new year. Write a novella during January - it's that simple.</p>
<p>Many people are scared off from either <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> or <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">SoCNoC</a> because it sounds like a daunting task. Fifty thousand words in a month really is a good challenge but here is an alternative for you.</p>
<p>Much like there are marathons and half-marathons, KiwiWriters now presents the half marathon of writing challenges. The <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/new-year-novella-2008.html">New Year Novella</a> Challenge (along with a <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/new-year-novella-2008/">forum</a>) is a great way to get started in doing stories that are just that bit longer, and you never know, it might give you a taster for one of the bigger challenges later in the year.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's my participant's icon:</p>
