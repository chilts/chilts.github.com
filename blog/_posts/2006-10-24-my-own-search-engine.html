<p>Not really mine, but a Google Customisation</p>
<p>A lot of times, I want to be able to search photographers portfolios. I chance upon them, but want a way to search them afterwards, to find that picture of a place I've been or a place I want to see.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to do this up until now has been hard.</p>
<p>Enter Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/eureka-your-own-search-engine-has.html">new</a> <a href="http://google.com/coop/cse">Custom Search Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm hoping that lots of people suggest new sites to add since it has a limited selection at the moment, Apart from the initial list of five sites, I can't seem to be able to add more - though I think they are going through some teething difficulties to be honest.</p>
<p>But it certainly looks promising for the future.
