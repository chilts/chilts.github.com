<p>I've just signed up for my first OpenID. It's nice.</p>
<p>The best thing about it is that I'm using <em>this</em> site <strong>http://kapiti.geek.nz/ (deprecated)</strong> as a delegate to my <a href="http://www.myopenid.com/">OpenID provider</a>. That way, if I ever want to move to another provider, I just have to change some of information in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of my index page and we're done.</p>
<p>Since then, I've used my new OpenID to:</p>
<ul><li>add a comment to a LiveJournal blog - <a href="http://jenny-1260.livejournal.com/">http://jenny-1260.livejournal.com/</a></li><li>sign in to <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">http://ma.gnolia.com/</a></li><li>soon, I will be claiming blogs at <a href="http://technorati.com/">http://technorati.com/</a></li><li>(probably lots of other stuff too)</li></ul>
<p>It's <strong>very</strong> cool.</p>
<p>If you want to use your own site for your OpenID go to this help page - <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/help#own_domain">Using your own URL</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I might try and add OpenID comments to <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated)</strong> or even make it (and hence <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>) become an OpenID Consumer! Now that would be something special.</p>
<p>P.S. If she hasn't got an OpenID already, I expect <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> will get one almost immediately after reading this!</p>
