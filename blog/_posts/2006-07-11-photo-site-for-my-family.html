<p>Previously, I set up a really simple photo site that members of my family
could log into and view photos in. This time I'm going to do it properly.</p>
<p>The old site was run on my computer at home via my cable modem. That made it
slightly slower for those guys, but there was a more major disadvantage. I
didn't yet give them the ability to upload their own photos.</p>
<p>This time I'm going to do it properly. It will be hosted on my server, it
will have proper login details and invites to friends and, of course, you'll
be able to upload your own images.</p>
<p>I think it should take between 2 and 3 weeks to get mostly right, then I'll
release it to the masses.</p>
