<p>In all the work that I've done in getting the KiwiWriters site up and going this year, I have just finished the thing that I am most proud of.</p>
<p>Finally, after many months of wrangling, I have pretty much wrapped up the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/">Challenge</a> section of the site. So let's look at the stages I had to go through to make it happen:</p>
<ul><li>I needed to do a quick release so we could use it for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/easter-challenge-2007.html">The 6,000 Word Easter Challenge</a> and prove the concept and implementation</li><li>that initial release did pretty well and not much was changed to be able to add <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2007.html">SoCNoC 2007</a> not long afterwards</li><li>at the same time, I added the lovely participation icons and the progress bars for anyone that wants them</li><li>since then, I've added the ability to choose your timezone and have the challenge work with your local time</li><li>I've just released updated code to actually use it :-)</li><li>next will be a script to log everyone's daily progress to the database</li><li>soon that will also be reported on the site</li><li>added to all this, the admin interface to add/edit/delete new events</li><li>plus finally, the ability for the members to add their own events</li></ul>
<p>So already there is quite a lot but the other thing I really like is that the challenges can be of many different types - not just word counting. I think it is an uber-cool feature that we wanted from the start and I'm very happy with the implementation being all nice and data-driven.</p>
<p>It seems other challenge-based writing sites put all their effort into one challenge a year, which to me, also sounds like <strong>manual-database-editing overhead-hell</strong>. Being someone who hates restrictions and one of the most important requirements for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> as a group was to have the ability to stage many challenges throughout the year and the ability to let members create their own.</p>
<p>So I/we made it multi-evented from the start and now it's blossoming into it's own little world. Soon we will have even more challenges:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/zing-thing-jul07.html">The Zing Thing</a> Challenge</li><li><a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/the-end-is-nigh-2007.html">The End is Nigh</a> Challenge</li></ul>
<p>...not to mention lots more when we release the 'member' challenge section.</p>
