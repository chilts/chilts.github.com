title: Searching with Swish-e and Swish++ - First Look
published: true
tags: [ search, index, swish-e, swish ]

<p>After playing with Swish++ today, I'm thinking, that looks cool but a little
unintuitive. Swish-e looks more straightforward.</p>
<p>After a bit of messing round, I managed to index a few files and search them
using <code>swish++</code>. The funny thing is, it seems to have slightly strange
ways of doing its command line arguments. Hmm.</p>
<p>I just read a little bit about <code>swish-e</code> that <code>swish++</code> was based on.
I'll learn a bit more about that tomorrow. Will probably post a few
comparisons sometime in the next few days.</p>
