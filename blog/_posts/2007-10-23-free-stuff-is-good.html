<p>I'm giving away free wine...</p>
<p>After Nate posted this - <a href="http://kiwinewt.geek.nz/blog/index.php/2007/10/23/new-thing-98-free-stuff/">New Thing #98: Free Stuff</a>, I decided to give away 5 bottles of wine.</p>
<p>I won them the other week but I'm not a wine drinker. It's really nice stuff, Grove Mill, Sauvignon Blanc 2006 and retails about $20 a bottle.</p>
<p>Here's the details. You must do ALL of these things:</p>
<ul><li>the first 5 people who leave a comment (only one per family)</li><li>you must be able to pick it up (since I'm not sending it in the post) or we have a mutual arrangement to hand it over</li><li>also give away 5 things on their blog</li></ul>
<p>All entries subject to my decision. Judges decision is final. No correspondence will be entered into.</p>
<p>Finally, well done Nate, I was thinking of doing something like this anyway but you just forced my hand :-)</p>
