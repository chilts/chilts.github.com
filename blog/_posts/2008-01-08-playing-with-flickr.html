<p>After getting my new digital camera today, I've started uploading some pictures to Flickr. It's fun.</p>
<p>Instead of using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> as a <a href="s3-revival.html">store for all my photos</a>, I'm just going to upload some of my favourites. Unfortunately, today I couldn't go out and take any nice pictures because of the terrible weather, so I took a few just to play around with the camera.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andychilton/2174255159/" title="20080107_154827 by andychilton, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2073/2174255159_5134401ca9_m.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="180" alt="20080107_154827" /></a>
</div>
<p>That's just the small version since I thought the medium version was 400 across and not 500 as it actually is.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is another photo to enjoy:</p>
