<p>This release has a number of new things and functionality.</p>
<p>Here's the short version of the changes, though there are quite a few since Saturday's release:</p>
<ul><li>now reads a <code>~/.cilrc</code> config file, so set your <code>UserName</code> and <code>UserEmail</code> in there</li><li>you can now filter on <code>--is-mine</code> which takes your email from your <code>~/.cilrc</code></li><li>you can now use shortened hash names for issues/comments/attachments, so long as they are unambiguous</li><li>a new command called 'am' has been added so you can process email messages into either new issues or comments on existing issues (ToDo: processing of multiple messages in actual Mailboxes)</li><li>allows dependencies between issues so you can state which <strong>DependsOn</strong> or <strong>Precedes</strong> another</li></ul>
<p>Documentation has been made a little nicer too.</p>
<p>There are still lots more ideas to get through but I'm sure it'll slow down at some point. As always, thanks to those who provide me with inspiration and ideas, <a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/">you know</a> who <a href="http://nigel.mcnie.name/">you are</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun, let me know how it goes and happy hacking.</p>
<p>Update: fix to packaging, patched to v0.4.1, see the main <a href="/software/cil.html">cil</a> page for tarball details.
