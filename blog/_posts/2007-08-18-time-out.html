<p>I'm holding my hands out, one upwards, one across the top. It's time for a Time Out.</p>
<p>This whole year has been busy. It's been fairly mad. Basically, it's been crazy since 1st January it seems. So I'm going to take a time out.</p>
<p>I've had people stay with me - which is nice, but each and every time this happens, I realise why I live by myself (and as Danny Bhoy said the other week - don't get <em>loneliness</em> and <em>being alone</em> mixed up). Of course, if I was <em>with</em> someone, that would be different, but at the moment, I'm not. Therefore, I like my own space.</p>
<p>Also, I've been hard at work with <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> and <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>. I've also tried to help set up 3 different people with a website of their very own. I realise that it's hard for me when someone says that they want a site, I end up saying &quot;I can help&quot;. In the end, it's much more hassle than it's worth especially if I'm not going to get anything from it either. At first, I wanted people to use Zaapt, but now I'm not as bothered since I feel Zaapt will eventually get a life of it's own anyway. Also, when it gets to the point where the person I'm doing the site for wants changes, it just becomes like work but mainly if they are not sensitive to the amount of time I'm putting in or have put in in the past. As soon as something becomes like work, then I'm outta there.</p>
<p>Also, there is a difference between a site where someone wants to make money and a site which is aimed at improving either people themselves or the world as a whole. Of course, you guys know that the latter is much more dear to my heart than the former and that's why those other commitments have got to go.</p>
<p>These past three weeks have been interesting in that I've only been at home in the evening for about 4 in 21. There's been lots going on and all the while, all the things I <em>should</em> have be doing have been mounting up. All those things I don't <em>have</em> to do, but I feel I ought to because I'd promised someone something. I'm at the stage now where I'm cutting things out because, and let's be honest here, I'm not getting anything back!</p>
<p>There are, however, exceptions to this. There are many, many things I love doing and won't ever stop doing them unless I get hit by a bus. So basically, I need to concentrate on those things I enjoy and the things I truly believe in. Both of the things I mentioned above, Zaapt and KiwiWriters are intertwined into something I truly believe in but all the rest, I've decided, I'm going to have to cut out.</p>
<p>From now on, I'm going to bite my lip whenever I'm about to say the words &quot;I can help&quot; and instead, consider whether I feel that it's for a cause I want to support.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two new things going round in my head for websites that <strong>I want</strong> to develop and you can be rest assured that one is related to <strong>open standards</strong> and the other is related to <strong>charitable organisations</strong>. Both of which, I'll do myself, neither of which will have time pressures and each will be pleasantly enjoyable.
