<p>There have been a number of good things things happening with Cil in the past week or so.</p>
<p>Just a few quick notes to start off with:</p>
<ul><li><a href="/software/cil.html">Cil</a> release <a href="/s/files/cil-0.5.1.tar.gz">v0.5.1</a> is new out today</li><li>a previous version of Cil has made it into <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cil.html">Debian</a>!</li><li>other people are <a href="http://www.email-reminder.org.nz/2008/07/new-source-repository-and-bug-tracker.html">using cil too</a></li></ul>
<p>When writing Open Source Software, it usually feels good to be able to give something back but it also feels better when someone is helping you too. <a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/">Francois</a> deserves <strong>all</strong> the credit getting Cil into <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and a lot of the credit for many other features already in Cil.</p>
<p>Now I just need to get my act together so I can contribute to <a href="http://www.email-reminder.org.nz/">email-reminder</a> - I promise there will be patches before sunrise.
