<p>I've been taking it easy the past few days though I have also been doing other stuff.</p>
<p>Basically it goes something like this. I was behind, I caught up, now I think I can make it. I'm currently on 44,999 so 5,001 words in the next five days should be easy enough! I have only started writing at about 10:30pm these last couple of days, but hopefully I'll finish by tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Instead of writing, I have been getting back into doing a bit on my site. Some things I've done in the past two days include:</p>
<ul><li>sending static content gzipped using mod_gzip (css and js)</li><li>putting MochiKit into kapiti.geek.nz in preparation for funky things :-)</li><li>changing the admin interface so I can delete comment spam more easily</li></ul>
<p>...plus some other bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Also, after chatting with the Wellington Write-In people today, there has been some talk of doing one in June as well as, or maybe instead of, November. For a start it's winter then whereas at the moment, it stays light far too long to be stuck inside all day. Other than that, we had a really good laugh for two hours (hi to everyone that was there).</p>
<p>I guess we'll see how it goes though I'd love to get involved in it again and maybe even do some webstuff for it.</p>
<p>P.S. <em>webstuff</em> is a technical term and if you don't know what it means, you never will!
