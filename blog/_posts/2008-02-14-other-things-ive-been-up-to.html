<p>I haven't posted in a while, but thought I'd let you know a couple of other things I've been up to.</p>
<p>It seems to have been pretty busy lately with 'just life', heading places, seeing people, enjoying the sun, but I really should get back to doing a bit more development stuff.</p>
<p>As a bit of an experiment, I have also been playing around with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> a lot more (please M$, don't buy Yahoo!, even if they are only good for Flickr). I have even set up a couple of groups too.</p>
<p>The first one is something that Donovan and I have been chatting about recently and that's having examples of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/nz-native-trees/">NZ Native Trees</a> so people can learn a bit more about them (okay, so <strong>I</strong> can learn a bit more). There is also a blog for <a href="http://nz-native-trees.blogspot.com/">NZ Native Trees</a>  which will showcase good example photos now and in future it will show tree, trunk, leaf, flower and seed examples of each native. It's a bit task (there are so few on Flickr) that we're going to have to take a lot of photos ourselves. If you can help, please add your photos, with tags, to the group.</p>

<p>The second group I started is one called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/amazing-structures/">Amazing Structures</a>. I've always been fascinated with what humans can engineer on such a large scale. Already there are lots of photos (and I've already learnt my lesson to put a limit on what people can post) so hopefully that will kinda snowball. Again, I have a blog showcasing some of the <a href="http://amazing-structures.blogspot.com/">best photos</a>.</p>
<p>My favourite so far is this one:</p>
