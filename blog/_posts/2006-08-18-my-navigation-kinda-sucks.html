<p>After reading an article on &quot;Web Navigation&quot;, I realise my fundamental flaws in my site's design. An update to be scheduled soon I think.</p>
<p>The article in question is <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/whereami">Where Am I?</a> by Derek Powazek. Even though there are some obvious points in there, it's amazing what you forget, don't think about or just plain ignore.</p>
<p>Whilst reading through the article, I kept referring back to these pages on kapiti.geek.nz. As it turns out, I need to update a few things:</p>
<ul><li>whilst I tried to provide some sort of &quot;Where have I been?&quot; using the stacked menus of the left, it fails miserably</li><li>the breadcrumbs (which I must admit, I've always liked) have a &quot;Navigation&gt;&gt;&quot; line above, but <strong>nothing happens</strong> in there - why?</li><li>the original design also had the above menu options highlighted when you were in that section - I didn't do it</li><li>and I <strong>am lazy</strong> since I don't un-link the links for the page I am currently on</li></ul>
<p>So overall, I give myself about 4/10 and a note from the teacher which says: &quot;Andrew must try harder and not let himself be distracted by others talking at the back&quot;!
