<p>It's finally time for some serious writing.</p>
<p>In about 2 hours, there will be the feint tapping of keyboards as they start ramping up at midnight for the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2007.html">inaugural Southern Cross Novel Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Amazingly, there are 40 people signed up for it, though I estimate there are at least another 4 or 5 who are doing it but haven't yet signed up. I consider that - even before the month has started - to be a major success.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to get a lot out of doing this type of challenge again. When I first wrote about starting NaNoWriMo (<a href="nanowrimo-starts-in-1hr03mins.html">NaNoWriMo Starts in 1hr 03mins</a>), I had no idea that it would be such an influence and have such an effect on me. Initially, that was because actually doing it and achieving it, I consider to be <a href="winning-nanowrimo-is-one-of-the-best-things-ever.html">one of my best ever</a>.</p>
<p>But lots more has happened since the end of NaNoWriMo. I met a whole group of really great people (<a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a>, <a href="http://www.angellic.org/">Jane</a>, Chris, Cassie and Josh, <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a> I already knew) and since then we started our own writing site, KiwiWriters, have our own challenges, and in developing the website for it, I now have my own <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Content Management System</strong> too :-)</p>
<p>Isn't it amazing how one tiny thing can blow into something of mega-proportions. <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>'s one line message to the IRC channel in my old work about a year ago has produced all of these things. Wow, just like a domino effect.</p>
<p>And finally in other news for those who don't know, I shall actually be going back to my old work, <a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst IT</a>, and it shall become my current work again :-)</p>
<p>Ah, happy days are here again. Oh, and wish me luck for the novel.
