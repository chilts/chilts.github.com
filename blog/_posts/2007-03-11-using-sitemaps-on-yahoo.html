<p>I have used Google Sitemaps for well over a year, even before they were standardised across search engines. In the spirit of freedom to index, I've claimed the KiwiWriters.org site on Yahoo! Sitemaps too. Let the battle begin.</p>
<p>The problem is, the Yahoo! Sitemaps (or should I say 'Site Explorer') just doesn't have as clear an interface as the Google one does. Neither does it have as many features. It does provide some that Google doesn't but not much.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll go into a discussion one day about the differences, but for now I'll leave it there.</p>
<p>Anyway, at least <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">Kiwi Writers</a> should be indexed properly by Yahoo! now. It's been a few days already so maybe I'll give it a few more.
