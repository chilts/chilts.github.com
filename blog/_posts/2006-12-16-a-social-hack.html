<p>This is just a short post to see if my entries still appear on ...</p>
<p>... <a href="http://planet.catalyst.net.nz/">Planet Catalyst</a>.</p>
<p>To those of you who don't know, as I said in my last post I have changed jobs. At my old place, <a href="http://www.catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst IT</a>, my entries used to be syndicated onto Planet Catalyst if I tagged my enties with <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/tag/PlanetCatalyst.html">PlanetCatalyst</a>. So I guess now that I've switched jobs, these entries shouldn't appear there - at least that's the theory.</p>
<p>So whoever in Catalyst reads this first, assuming this entry appears, do you wanna remove me ... alternatively, how about having a Planet Catalyst Alumni :-)</p>
<p>Finally, it was nice to catch up with a number of you last night and I'll definately see you again in the New Year.
