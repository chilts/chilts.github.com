<p>So after thinking about it for a while, I did it.</p>
<p>Here's a list of changes I've made:</p>
<ul><li>the menu system on the left is a bit easier and less cluttered</li><li>the titles of each page are now the names of the page instead of a rubbish static one</li><li>added which section you're currently in to the section bar above.</li><li>added a links section to the blog to other people around Wellington (thanks Don, good idea)</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I've also added a new 'content' section to the site which now serves up the index, about and credits pages. This way (moreso for the index page), I can change it regularly without having to do code changes and a new deploy.</p>
<p>In all this, I've certainly used a fair few nice Mason techniques including  attributes and methods.</p>
<p>And just to get you off my back, I know I should have been writing tonight for NaNoWriMo, but I just felt like a night off!
