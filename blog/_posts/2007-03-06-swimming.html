<p>A short title and that's exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I went swimming yesterday for the first time in a long time. I decided that I really ought to get myself active again since the past few months have been fairly sedative.</p>
<p>I haven't been swimming for a while - about 3 years or so but I found the <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/swimpools/details/wellaquatic.html">Wellington Aquatic Centre</a> to be very good. It is also kinda cool since there is shedloads of space for people wanting to do lanes.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we used to watch the oldies swim up and down and become completely bored, but I guess it's amazing how things change as you grow up (something I'm still working on). But now when I go to the swimming pool, that's exactly what I want to do. Even better than that, there are no kids around since the whole of the middle pool (yes, there are three) is for lanes only.</p>
<p>There is a diving board area and there were also people doing aquajogging, which I found fairly funny. Hopefully as I get older still, I won't be doing that. Overall, the place certainly tries to cater for every audience so full marks to them.</p>
<p>The only downside is that they charge you $4 to get in and then <em>another</em> $1 for a locker! I find this unreasonable since they know there is nowhere else you can put your clothes when you're in the pool. This is like having to buy food from a train buffet car or when you're on a ferry - since you have no other choice they charge the earth.</p>
<p>Very irritating though I now have to come up with a plan to get around it short of turning up in my trunks and goggles.
