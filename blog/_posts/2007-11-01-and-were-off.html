<p>NaNoWriMo has begun and I've got a flying start.</p>
<p>We in Wellington had the Kick-Off gethering last night and it was great. Amazingly we got 17 people there and I know there were more who intended on coming. Overall though, it was a fantastic start.</p>
<p>And now, we're just 8hrs 25mins into it and I've already got my daily word quote.  I'm on 1685 and I would love to double that tonight. I'm making no promises though I intend to finish at least more than a few days early this year.</p>
<p>The other news is, I shall be posting each and every day's writing on this site. I'm as yet undecided if I shall be just putting it up as content or as a blog, but I'm leaning towards the former since I already have a <a href="/writing/">writing</a> section and even though it's based on time (one a day) it's actually for a brief moment (one month). Every so often I'll point to any new stuff there from here so you don't miss out.</p>
<p>Wish me luck :-) This is going to be oarsum (oh wait, I should say awesome if we're talking about writing and not geek stuff).
