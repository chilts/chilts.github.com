title: PgPatcher now has it's 2 executables
published: true
tags: [ postgresql, pg-patcher, google-code ]

<p>They have been uploaded to the Google Code repository for initial viewing.</p>
<p>Now that I have polished up the executables (bugs to be found), I will start on the rest of the repository, including the packaging.</p>
<p>They already have documentation in the form of POD and the packaging will make the man pages from them. There is also an example set of patch files which can show how PgPatcher and PgCreatePatch can help patch PostgreSQL databases.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are still things to write up about it all, but the first stop should be the <a href="/software/pgpatcher.html">PgPatcher Index</a> page.</p>
<p>The original version of this script was written by Martyn Smith around a year ago. It was generalised and polished by me and after swearing I didn't like SF, finally decided to release it since Google Code is a lot nicer.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!
