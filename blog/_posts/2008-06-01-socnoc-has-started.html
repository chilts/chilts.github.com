<p>Already, we're underway for the Southern Cross Novel Challenge.</p>
<p>A few people have stayed up to chat in the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/how-do-i/223.html">KiwiWriters chatroom</a> and <a href="http://www.kerrynangell.com/">Kerryn Angell</a> (founder of KiwiWriters) set us all going once midnight passed here in NZ.</p>
<p>Starting the month off with 98 participants is a good start and I think we'll even get a higher percentage of winners compared to last year too. With people all around New Zealand and Australi to Finland, the UK and the US, it's truely a worldwide event now.</p>
<p>To all those participating in <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2008.html">SoCNoC 2008</a>, have fun and happy writing.
