<p>Warning: advert for geeks to unite.</p>
<p>As has been always this year, I'm going to the <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington PerlMongers</a> meeting tomorrow night, so if anyone is interested, please come along. There are four speakers lined up so it's going to be a busy one.</p>
<p>Also, there is a new User Group starting next month. A few others in <a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst</a> (I think Finlay, <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> and <a href="http://she.geek.nz/">Penny</a>) have been organising getting the <a href="http://pgug.org.nz/">New Zaland PostgreSQL Users Group</a> up and going so put the first Tuesday of each month in your calendar for that one.
