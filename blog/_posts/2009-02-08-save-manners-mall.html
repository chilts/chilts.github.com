<p>As we all know, kicking pedestrians out of town is just the wrong thing to do. Putting more traffic right in the centre of town is even worse.</p>
<p>Added to the fact that Manners Mall is a rather quaint place (ok, there are some varmints there late at night, but I'd rather be able to walk through it during the day than have to wait for YET ANOTHER traffic light to cross the road).</p>
<p>I hate waiting for traffic, I hate the smell and I hate the fact that this city council only ever does things for motorised vehicles and never pedestrians or cyclists.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop even more traffic jamming up the centre of Wellington, go and sign the petition (via the council's own website) to <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/haveyoursay/e-petitions/ep/details/52">Save Manner's Mall</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a blog in Wellington and have some Wellingtonian readers who might also be interested, post this link and let's get the council to rethink.
