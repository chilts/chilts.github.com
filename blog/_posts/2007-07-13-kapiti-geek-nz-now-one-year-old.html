<p>Yay! Party time. Excellent!</p>
<p>Not much more to say that that except I <em>still</em> need to update <a href="/">KapitiGeekNZ (now chilts.org)</a> to a new design.</p>
<p>Am not sure where time has disappeared since June but consider Christchurch and Postgres being my major time sinks.</p>
<p>Anyways, am looking forward to a good weekend of doing things, lots of things, so I hope you have a good one too.</p>
<p>P.S. Fridays and Sundays are the <em>best</em> days of the week!
