Original recipe from <em>GoodFood, 101 More low-fat feasts</em>, BBC Books.

## Method ##

1. Preheat oven to 200&deg;C.
1. Chop onion and capsicum and stir-fry with oil in a frying pan.
1. Tip the rice in to soak up the flavours followed by the stock for half a minute. Transfer everything into an
   ovenproof dish.
1. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix well.
1. Cover and bake for 40 mins until there is no liquid left and the rice is sticky and creamy.
1. Mix in parsley or basil. Grate cheese on top. Replace lid and leave for a few minutes on top of the oven just to
   melt the cheese.

## Notes ##

Instead of plain oil, I usually use a Thai chilli sauce (not sweet chilli) to give it more flavour.
