## Method ##

1. Crumble the yeast into a small bowl and mash in the sugar. Add the 3 teaspoons of water and cream the mixture
   together.
1. Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture is puffed up and frothy.
1. Sift the flour and salt into a large, warmed bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeast mixture and
   remaining lukewarm water. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, gradually draw the flour into the liquid. Continue mixing
   until the flour is incorporated and the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.
1. Turn out on to a lightly floured board and knead for 10 minutes. The dough should be elastic and smooth. Rinse and
   dry the bowl and return the dough to it. Cover with a damp cloth and set the bowl in a warm, draught-free
   place. Leave for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough has risen and almost doubled in bulk.
1. Turn the risen dough on to the floured surface and knead it for a further 3 minutes.
1. The dough is now ready for use.
