## Method ##

For ravioli, the sheets of pasta should be almost translucent, I've rolled these sheets a fair bit thicker than that.

1. Sift your flour into a mound on your work table, make a well in the middle.
1. Beat both eggs. Stir the salt into the beaten eggs, and pour it into the well.
1. Starting from the centre, and using a fork (or your fingers if you wish), mix it in a circular motion, incorporating
   a bit more of the flour at a time as you go along, until the mixture is no longer squishy, then you can chuck the
   fork in the sink, roll up your sleeves, and knead it around a bit until it gets a bit of an elastic feel and a nice
   sheen.
1. Wrap it tightly in clingwrap and set it aside for at least 15 minutes (preferably 30 or more) to rest. This will
   help to make it a lot more manageable when you're rolling it out. If you're going to be rolling by hand, you might
   want to let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour to an hour and a half.
1. Divide the dough into two, and roll it into 2 rough balls, then flatten one into a rectangular piece and keep the
   other under a damp tea towel. Run it through the widest setting of your pasta roller twice, then fold it over and
   run it through again. Repeat this 2 or 3 times.
1. Crank the setting down and slowly get it to the thinness you require, then you're ready to cut it up and/or fill it,
   and cook it!

## Notes ##

Keep in mind that fresh pasta takes a lot less time to cook than dried pasta. This lot only took about 3 minutes to get
to al dente and was divinely silky on the outside, soaked up all the flavour from the sauce, and still had a good bite
left to it.
