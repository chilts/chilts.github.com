An unleavened Indian bread that can be enjoyed with any vegetable or curry. Original recipe at [Show Me the
Curry](http://showmethecurry.com/breads/rotli-roti-indian-bread-recipe.html).

## Method ##

1. Mix flour and salt well in a large bowl. Add oil and mix until lumps are gone.
1. Add warm water a little at a time which will form a medium soft dough ball. Do not overwork the dough.
1. Drizzle a few drops of oil over dough and let it rest for 15 mins.
1. Heat skillet/frying pan on medium heat.
1. Knead the dough once more and divide into golf ball size portions.
1. Dip one ball in all-purpose flour to roll out into a thin disc. Use more flour as necessary to stop it sticking.
1. Place into skillet and cook allowing slight bubbles to form, flip over for a further 15 secs.
1. To expand the roti (optional) pick up with tongs and place over the open flame (assuming a gas cooker) until it
   balloons up. Flip over and cook on the other side.
1. Place into insulated container and smear with Ghee or (clarified) butter and repeat for remaining dough
