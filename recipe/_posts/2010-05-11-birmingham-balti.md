I really liked this recipe. Originally from the [Vegetarian
Society](http://www.vegsoc.org/nvw/2006/recipes/aubbalti.html) website. Otherwise known as "Aubergine, Potato and Chick
Pea Balti" but I like the name "Birmingham Balti" better.

For the vegetables:

* 2 tbs vegetable oil
* 1 onion, peeled and finely sliced
* ½ tsp cumin seeds
* 1 potato, peeled and cut into 1 cm cubes
* 1 aubergine, cut into 1 cm cubes
* 410g tin chickpeas, rinsed & drained
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* ¼ tsp ground turmeric

For the sauce:

* 2 tbs vegetable oil
* 1 onion, peeled and finely sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 tsp root ginger, peeled and grated
* 4 cm  cassia bark (optional)

* 450g tin chopped plum tomatoes
* ¼ tsp ground turmeric
* ½ tsp ground coriander
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* 1½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp red chilli powder to taste

To finish:

* 4 tbs fresh coriander, finely chopped

   taste. Cook on a high heat for 2 minutes.
1. Lower to a medium heat and cook for a further 3 minutes stirring occasionally.
1. Remove the cassia bark and blend the sauce roughly with a hand blender. Add the vegetables to the sauce along with
   the finishing ingredients: chopped coriander, the water and the garam masala.
