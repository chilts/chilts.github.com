From [WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Own-Tortillas).

I find that these are beautiful in comparison to the ones found in the vacuum packs in the shops. They're also way
cheaper too.

## Method ##

1. Combine flour, salt, & baking powder in a large medium/large bowl.
1. Cut in shortening until lumps are gone.
1. Make a well (indentation) in the center of the dry ingredients.
1. Add water, about a half a cup at a time, and work mixture into a dough. #Knead until smooth. The dough should be
   slightly sticky but not hard. You can add slightly more water or flour if needed.
1. Cover and set aside for 10 minutes.
1. Form dough into balls about the size of eggs.
1. Using a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into about a 6 inch circle.
1. Heat griddle or skillet on med heat without grease.
1. Cook tortilla 1/2 to 1 minute (if it starts to bubble, that's long enough).
1. Flip tortilla to the other side and cook for a few seconds.
1. Continue in this manner until all your dough is cooked.

## Notes ##

* To make fewer tortillas, only use half the measurements of each ingredient.
* Making good tortillas takes practice. Eventually you will be able to get them round.
* If you don't like fluffy tortillas, you can eliminate the baking powder.
* Keeping the griddle hot makes the tortillas cook fast. If you find they are burning before they are cooked, turn the
  heat down slightly.
* If you do not have a rolling pin, you can use a small round bottle or even a broom handle!
* Small hand-operated presses are available in some Latino cooking supply stores, if you want an easy way to shape
  tortillas.
