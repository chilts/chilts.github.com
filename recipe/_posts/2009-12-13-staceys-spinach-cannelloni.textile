h2. Method

Chop the onion and mince the garlic.

Heat a dash of oil in a frying pan and cook the onion and garlic until soft. Stir in the prepared Chopped Spinach and
set aside to cool.

Stir in the Cottage Cheese, half the grated cheese, egg and nutmeg. Season with pepper.

Combine the Tomato pasta sauce and water. Pour half into the base of a lasagne-style dish.

Fill the cannelloni shells with the cottage cheese filling and place the cannelloni on top of the soup. Pour over the
remaining tomato sauce mixture to cover. Mix the remaining Parmesan cheese with the fresh breadcrumbs and pine nuts and
sprinkle over the dish.

Bake at 190°C for 25-30 minutes until the cannelloni is tender.
