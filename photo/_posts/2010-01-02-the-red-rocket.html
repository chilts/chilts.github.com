    Welcome to the first image in my photo blog. And of course, what else do you expect other than my bike as the first
    photo!

    It's called <strong>The Red Rocket</strong> and in this particular image, it has slicks on, rather than
    knobblies. This was after a number of us
    did <a href="http://www.feelinggreat.co.nz/events/sport-and-recreation/468-bike-the-bays-free">Bike the Bays</a>
    last year, then Stacey, Richard and I went for lunch afterwards.
