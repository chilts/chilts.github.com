<p>I would also appreciate a link back to this part of the site if you copy or redistribute parts of it, but this is not required. I would <strong>love</strong> to hear about any <em>remixes</em> of any <em>Choose your own Adventures</em> since I think that will be funny - how about <em>Make your own Adventure</em> :-) Contact me if you wish to license any of these works under terms different to the above.</p>
