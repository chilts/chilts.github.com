## chilts ##

Living in the lovely Wellington in New Zealand, it's a perfect place to be a geek. It's quite like San Francisco but
it's a much smaller place. Our harbour is great and the tech community is awesome! :)

I like Perl, JavaScript, Node.js, NoSQL, startups and Web APIs. See my [project](/project/) pages for more information
or check out the various links to sites around the place from my footer.

I also like non-creative interests include cycling, football, personal finance, living a simple but fulfilling life and
reading.
