<p>OpenGeoData has a post today which talks about Google's new MapMaker. It seems the Ad Broker wants to own what you do but gives nothing back.</p>
<p>Needless to say I'm completely disappointed in Google yet again but that's coming as no surprise these days. Head over to OpenGeoData and read the entry for yourself - <a href="http://www.opengeodata.org/?p=307">Google Want to be TeleAtlas</a></p>
<p>Recently, I've been looking at <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> a lot and have tried (and tried) to get something going so that I can map both Seatoun and Mt Vic. I refuse to install Flash to use their web editor but also the version which runs on Java isn't working for me either!</p>
<p>A short while ago, I thought that I'd like to make a nice, small and simple Gtk version but I just had a better idea. What about making a JavaScript version? That would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Currently I have no time but this might be one of those ideas that simmers for a while and then one day, I try it and see what happens. I fear it will be a big project but wouldn't that be just awesome!</p>
<p>As for helping Google map the world and taking your data, thxb'nothx.
