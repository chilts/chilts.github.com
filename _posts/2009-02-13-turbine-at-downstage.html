<p>I went to a preview showing of the play &quot;Turbine&quot; last night. And I'll tell you what, it was pretty awesome stuff.</p>
<p>There was only about 30 people in the audience which made it quite intimate. However that didn't detract from the atmosphere but actually made it better.</p>
<p>We were in row two which meant that in a lot of scenes, you really felt like you were within this family's home, especially so because you knew there were only a couple of people sitting behind you instead of the whole auditorium.</p>
<p>As for the play itself, it was pretty imaginative in some of the things it did (I especially liked the 'dancing' scene with two of the main characters). The actors also did some funny things with their scenery and set (no, not like that) but you'll have to go and see it to figure out what I mean.</p>
<p>Over the years in Wellington I've seen a few small productions either at Downstage or Bats and this one is definitely the best I've seen. The actors in this were excellent all round, especially so when a few of them had to change character for a moment or two.</p>
<p>The preview ticket was just $20 though the regular tickets are anything from $20 up to $42. Getting second row seats for $20 now seems like a pretty good bargain.</p>
<p>I'd heartily recommend going to see <a href="http://www.downstage.co.nz/shows/2009/turbine.asp">Turbine</a>.  It was a good play, the script was generally good (though the ending could have been a little better) and had some pretty dark humour at times, the local jokes made some patches even funnier but the acting was the winner for me - they really got it in to and it was emotional at times, both happy and sad.</p>
<p>Have fun if you go along.
