<p>I'm going to estimate a few things for the inaugural Southern Cross Novel Challenge.</p>
<p>At the moment, the statistics on the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> site reads something like this:</p>
<ul><li>there are 80 who people have registered on the site</li><li>of these, 40 are signed up to the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2007.html">SoCNoC</a> challenge</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, not everyone will complete the challenge (here's hoping they do though), but I predict we'll get a good percentage of finishers. Basically, because the whole thing is new, everyone is getting really excited, therefore I think the percentage will be higher this year than in later years.</p>
<p>So, I hope that 50% of that 40 will finish, therefore, 20 people will get their gold stars and certificates. That also means that from those 20 people, we'll have written something over 1,000,000 words!</p>
<p>Wow, that's a <strong>lot</strong> of words.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be higher (fingers crossed) or lower than this, but remember this figure also doesn't include the people who write 5,000, 500 or 50 words rather than 50,000!</p>
<p>There's going to be lots of bashing on keyboards in the next few weeks, both in New Zealand and abroad. Ah, happy days!
