title: Need to Re-write Kapiti.Geek.NZ using Zaapt
published: true

<p>This website was a precursor to Zaapt. It laid the foundations for what Zaapt would be based on but with a many more nicer features.</p>
<p>It's about this stage now that I need to re-write this site, kapiti.geek.nz using Zaapt and that means three things:</p>
<ul><li>I'll get a nicer interface, more functionality and a better framework (one that is updated, this one is just static now since I'm not developing it further)</li><li>I have to migrate all the data across. I guess I'll just write a quick script to import all the blog entries and the few content managed pages I have</li><li>I'll use this opportunity to do a re-design (or should I say re-skin) of the site</li></ul>
<p>As always though, the main problem I have is <strong>time</strong>. Maybe one day someone will invent a way to make more time to use in each and every day...</p>
<p>...or is that called <em>retirement</em>. :-)
