<p>Yet again, things are well in the land of Wellington.</p>
<p>So I meant to blog last week about going to see <a href="http://www.wellingtonphoenix.com/">The Phoenix</a> smash 4 goals past Perth Glory. That was one entertaining and hugely enjoyable match. As each match comes around, watching the Phoenix just gets better and better even if we are having fairly random results. You always bump into someone you know at the match, singing along with <a href="http://www.yellowfever.co.nz/">Yellow Fever</a> is always funny and the crowd entertainment value is excellent.</p>
<p>This week, I managed to walk the <a href="http://www.carboncrusade.com/">Carbon Crusade</a> and planted 5 trees for it too. All good fun.</p>
<p>In other news, both good and bad. I managed to win a crate of wine at the Carbon Crusade from <a href="http://wellington.morefm.co.nz/">More FM</a>. It's the first time I've ever entered a competition on the radio but I only did it 'coz I figured I actually had good odds of winning - and I did :-)</p>
<p>But the bad news is, I've gone and made my injury worse. After not playing footy for 3 weeks, I then proceeded to jump across the stream eager to plant my trees - and promptly pulled my groin again. So it looks like I'll be out of action for even longer, which I'm very miffed about.</p>
<p>Finally, I went to the <a href="http://www.nzso.co.nz/the_concerts/subscription_tours/subscribe_0507_prog_2">NZSO last night</a> and can honestly say was my favourite night there in a while. Plus, I have tickets to see <a href="http://www.nzopera.com/productions/2007/turandot.cfm">Turandot</a> in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>As always, Wellington is keeping me busy.</p>
<p>I love this place.
