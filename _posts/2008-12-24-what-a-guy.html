<p>This week something magical happened and therefore there is someone we owe a great deal of thanks to. As is usual with open source it took one person a huge amount of effort to step up and complete something that needed to be done.</p>
<p>Two days ago, it was announced that the <a href="http://use.perl.org/articles/08/12/22/0830205.shtml">Perl 5 repository was being shifted to Git</a>. After many hours, days and months wrangling with all of the numerous repositories that Perl 5 has used in the past, <a href="http://sam.vilain.net/">Sam Vilain</a> managed to somehow mung it all into one coherent Git repo!</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I remember when he would speak to us in work when he was probably right in the middle of doing his various custom conversion tools. He'd be telling us about <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> and how other version control systems were lacking in comparison. There was definitely a point whereby everyone would take the piss and note &quot;<em>Hey Sam, you talking about version control systems again?</em>&quot; It is obviously a subject near and dear to his heart.</p>
<p>I'm lucky though since I get to work with such clever and interesting people. Usually those who I consider a bit of a hero due to all of the work they have done, either in groups or individually and for such a good cause (in my opinion) too.</p>
<p>I get to speak to Sam quite regularly, sometimes Perl and sometimes whatever other random subject he's been looking into recently. He's even contributed to a a project of mine (<a href="/software/cil.html">cil</a>) though wish I could say the help was reciprocal. Admittedly, I don't always understand what he's saying - not the words mind, just the sentences(!) - but that's okay, it's good to listen to someone who is a naturally free thinker.</p>
<p>I also found another link from the GitHub guys who also obviously took a liking to our Sam (describing his effort as a heroic one): <a href="http://github.com/blog/276-perl-mirror-on-github">A Perl Clone Appearing on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Just as an interesting note, if I were to describe Sam and his Perl exploits in terms of the TV show Red Dwarf, he'd be a bit like the 'Ace' version of Arnold Rimmer from a parrallel universe. You know, the one where 'Ace' always says:</p>
<blockquote>Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast!</blockquote>
<p>to which the rest of the crew just mutter:</p>
<blockquote>What a guy!</blockquote>
<p>Sam, you're a good guy, well done and thanks for all your effort in porting the Perl 5 repo over to Git. Sometimes I feel both Perl and Git go hand in hand since they both have that powerful yet non-restrictive way about them.</p>
<p>And finally, to sign off ... if I were one of the Arnold Rimmers from a parallel universe, I'd be the classic Rimmer we all know and love. And his phrase would be quite apt at this very moment in time:</p>
<blockquote>Stoke me a clipper, I'll be back for Christmas.</blockquote>
<p>Signing off for this year, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone!
