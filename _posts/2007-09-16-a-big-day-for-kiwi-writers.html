<p>After a long time planning, developing and testing, Member Challenges are now live on KiwiWriters.</p>
<p>Today saw the launch of a brand new section of the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> site; the ability for <strong>members to create their own challenges</strong>. Not only that but it can also be of one of a number of different types of challenge too.</p>
<p>Most writing sites which hold challenges have two limitations, both of which I always wanted to avoid:</p>
<ul><li>they seem to only hold one per year (or at least just one at a time)</li><li>the challenge itself is usually of one particular type</li></ul>
<p>From the very start, the KiwiWriters committee said &quot;let's have member challenges&quot; (I forget who's idea it was), so since that day I've been planning on having something completely flexible. I have blogged about this before - <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/my-proudest-moment-for-kiwiwriters.html">My Proudest Moment for KiwiWriters</a> - and all that hard work is now paying off.</p>
<p>We allow writing challenges, editing challenges, time-based challenges, preparation challenges and random-other-stuff challenges. There is plenty of variation and scope for whatever it is people out there want to do and best of all, they can do it whenever they want, there's no need to wait around for one of those other challenges to start. Also, any other member people can join in your challenge too, which after all, was the whole point in the first place.</p>
<p>Gladly one member has already added our first ever member challenge - <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/member/survival-of-the-human-race.html">Survival of the Human Race</a> and we're hoping for a number of people to join. So overall, it's been a very exciting day.</p>
<p>Now then, it's not often I boast but for the first time in a while, I'd like to blow my own trumpet (as it were). Technologically speaking, I'd like to summarise what the KiwiWriters challenge part of the site has over and above all the other writing sites I've seen:</p>
<ol><li>most sites only have 1 challenge a year, we have many</li><li>most sites only have 1 type of challenge, we have many</li><li>most sites only have challenges that the administrators add, we also allow our members to add them</li><li>some sites remove everything from the site regarding the old challenges, we keep a 100% record of everything</li></ol>
<p>We also have all these added extra features too which not all sites have either:</p>
<ol><li>working within everyone's own timezone</li><li>saving of each day's progress</li><li>a history of every challenge each member has ever entered</li><li>automatic certificates and progress banners</li><li>plus, soon to come, progress charts for each member for each challenge</li></ol>
<p>So overall, it's been a hell of a lot of work to get everything going and now I'm just hoping that this new feature will be the '<strong>killer app</strong>' for the site and that lots more people will start using it.</p>
<p>One area I'd love to expand is to get writing groups to use our site for their own challenges. Setting up infrastructure like that and getting it going is quite hard and really time-consuming. People shouldn't have to do all that themselves and instead, I've already done it. Instead, they just go to the site, create a challenge, get people to join and away you go. People don't even have to look at the rest of the site if they don't want to but hopefully, that would be a good drawcard to introduce people to other parts of the site. It's a great tool for encouragement and for being pushed (or pulled) along with a wave of other people.</p>
<p>One of my biggest dreams however, is to get schoolteachers, obviously English teachers, to add their bigger homework/project assignments as a challenge within the site and to get all of their pupils to <em>accept the challenge</em>. Just imagine all those extra words the kids would write if they knew their best friend was ahead of them. We all know from experience that doing something in a group gives you more encouragement, a greater sense of involvement and an incentive to do even more than you could ever imagine. I think that this would be a great way for kids to write more and have lots more fun in the process...</p>
<p>...after all, that's exactly what the whole site is aiming to achieve.
