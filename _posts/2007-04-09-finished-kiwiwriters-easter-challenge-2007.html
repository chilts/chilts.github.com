<p>After 3 days of hard work, I've completed the 6,000 words required for the KiwiWriters Easter Challenge.</p>
<p>And here is my winner's banner to prove it:</p>
<p class="c"><img src="http://kapiti.geek.nz/s/icons/easter-challenge-2007-winner.png" title="KiwiWriters Easter Challenge 2007" /></p>
<p>My next problem however, is that I have only written 11 scenes out of 15 I so still have four more scenes to go. I knew I had 15 to write and thought I'd hit around 7,500 words but it looks like it'll be more like 8,000 words in total.</p>
<p>I've promised that I will edit this story, but watch out for a full (unedited) posting here in the next few days.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/easter-challenge-2007.html">Easter Challenge</a> if you think you might want to try it next year or for any of the other challenges we have going over at <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>.</p>
