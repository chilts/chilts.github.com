<p>Before SoCNoC started in June, our hit count was ramping up. Now it's gone off the scale.</p>
<p>Our progress over the last few months has been reasonably steady. In February we were hitting a couple of hundred hits a day. In Mar and April, it was more like a few hundred.</p>
<p>Then May really started taking off. We hit our record on about 6 different days, going from 300ish to well over 600 and hitting, 700, 800 and then 900 on the 31st May,</p>
<p>I expected June would take us over a thousand, say 1,500, but it's gone completely crazy. We're now getting almost 3,000 hits per day!!!</p>
<p>Of course, me being the optimist says that if we keep this up and do a few more, then we might even get 100,000 for the whole month. Now that would be something special.</p>
<p>:-) Happy :-) Happy :-) Joy :-) Joy :-)
