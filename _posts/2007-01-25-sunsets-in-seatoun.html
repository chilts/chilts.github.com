<p>A walk when I got home from work and a quick drive to see the sunset.</p>
<p>Being here in Seatoun has been like a breath of fresh-air for me. I did like it up in Kapiti (hence, that's why I'm keeping the kapiti.geek.nz domain), but I just feel more at home here. It's only a few minutes to work which is absolutely great.</p>
<p>We're cut off from the rest of Wellington due to the hill over Seatoun Heights, but that's not to say we're very far from it - it's still only 15 mins to the centre of town. Also, over the past few days, I have headed out for a walk just to chill out after the working day. Up and around the headland is a beautiful walk from which you can see the South Island on a clear day and over the whole of Wellington harbour and the harbour opening.</p>
<p>One of the other bonuses though is the ability to head to Wahine Memorial Park on the south coast and watch the sunsets from there. It's very rocky on the coast and it's great for chucking stones into the water (nope, I haven't grown up yet). Already I have already seen a few good sunsets this year, though the low clouds in Wellington sometimes spoil it slightly.</p>
<p>Did I also say that there isn't much traffic round here either :-)</p>
<p>All in all, I can't think of a more beautiful place to live, work and enjoy the scenery.
