<p>For wellington.geek.nz, we now have other people administering certain calendars.</p>
<p>Well okay, we have one person administering their own calendar (<a href="http://wellington.geek.nz/blog/latest-happenings-on-the-site.html">read about it on the new blog</a>) but it's a start and here's why.</p>
<p>Before now, I have usually given out blanket permissions to do something on a site (e.g. on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>) but now it's much more refined. I'm creating specific permissions, with specific roles and correct assignment of such and therefore being much more detailed about who can do what.</p>
<p>This is all possible because I recently <a href="zaapt-unrecognisable-from-two-weeks-ago.html">added RBAC to Zaapt</a> and this is proof it works and works really well.</p>
<p>There are still lots of things to do on Zaapt but as each day passes, it gets more complete.
