<p>After my article last week regarding Dynamic Method Generation in Perl, here's the conclusion.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/fun-hacking-perl.html">Fun Hacking Perl</a> first unless you've already seen it. It took me a week instead of a day to post this follow up... :-)</p>
<p>Overall, dynamically creating methods can seem like a bit of black magic, some hand waving, smoke and mirrors or all three. But in reality it's fairly straight-forward.</p>
<p>Go take a look at the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kasei/Class-Accessor-0.30/lib/Class/Accessor.pm">Class::Accessor</a> module (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/KASEI/Class-Accessor-0.30/lib/Class/Accessor.pm">source</a>) and search for <code>::$accessor_name</code> (there are 4 instances). It's fairly straight forward and really there are only two steps you have to do:</p>
<ol><li>create an anonymous subroutine (or closure) using <code>sub</code></li><li>inject it into the caller's (being <code>$class</code>} namespace</li></ol>
<p>Of course, there is a few more things you have to be weary of and a few more details to look out for but essentially, that's it.</p>
<p>So far, I now have 5 ways of generating 5 different types of methods. It's kinda cool and means I can remove a lot of template code from <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a>.
