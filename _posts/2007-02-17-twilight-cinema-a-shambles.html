<p>The Twilight Cinema came to Wellington for the summer. Like most of their audience, they really needn't have bothered turning up.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, myself and a couple of friends went to watch the screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/">An Inconvenient Truth</a>. When we got to the Twilight Cinema we were told that <em>for technical reasons</em> the screening wasn't showing and instead some other (already previously shown) film was to be shown (<em>Dave Chappelle's Block Party</em>).</p>
<p>We had no interest in watching it.</p>
<p>We went home.</p>
<p>Tonight, we went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/">Little Miss Sunshine</a>. One of the best films to be released in recent years, with a load of other people, all laughing together at a truely great and funny movie. At least that's what we hoped.</p>
<p>We should have known better.</p>
<p>Before we were even inside, the lady came along the row and said that they were having some <em>technical difficulties</em>, but it would be starting just half an hour after it's scheduled start. If that didn't work, then they would show <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> instead.</p>
<p>So I thought, &quot;Ok, I'd like to see that too&quot; seeing as we hadn't seen it the last time we went.</p>
<p>By well over an hour after the scheduled start time, we saw something happen on the projector. We could see the film being put in though it wasn't quite in properly. The light from the projector then proceeded to burn a hole in the film and before our very eyes, it disintegrated. 'Oopse' we thought. I hope that wasn't the film.</p>
<p>When the film did finally come on, about an hour and a half late, there was no sound. Ah great, another hiccup. Fifteen minutes of the film were shown with no sound before they then told us that they were going to pack it all in and show the alternative instead.</p>
<p>By this time it was late and I was tired - tired of the whole thing. The pre-show entertainment wasn't really entertainment (though you couldn't hear the first person since she had no microphone) and by this time I wanted to go home.</p>
<p>All in all, the whole event was a <a href="http://www.twilightcinema.co.nz/">complete shambles</a> and it has completely put me off going to any of their events again. They gave me a ticket that I could use another night, but now I wished I'd just asked for my money back.</p>
<p>I mean really, if I went again, it would be a <a href="http://www.twilightcinema.co.nz/Wellington/WhatsOn/WhatsOn.html">complete waste of time</a> like the previous two times before. I had heard that they were not enjoying as much success as they'd hoped and from what I've seen, they really don't deserve it.</p>
<p>If anyone has any good experiences I'd like to know.
