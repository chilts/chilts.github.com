<p>On 15th October, I have pledged to blog about the environment.</p>
<p>As it says:</p>
<blockquote>What would happen if every blog published posts discussing the same issue, on the same day?</blockquote>
<blockquote>One issue. One day. Thousands of voices.</blockquote>
<p>That issue is: <strong>the environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a> and pledge your support.</p>
