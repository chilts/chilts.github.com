<p>The thing is, it wasn't blatently clear, though of course, when I looked after, it is!</p>
<p>D'oH!</p>
<p>Anyway, the real question is, how the hell do I know that it hasn't been nicked? I mean, there's no note, nothing saying &quot;Hey, dude, we've got your car, huh, huhuh, huhuhuh!&quot; No phone number to call.</p>
<p>Not like you can call the fuzz and say &quot;So erm, I'd like to report a stolen car, unless it's been towed. Can you find out for me, oh gowan, please!&quot;</p>
<p>So I guess I'll get a letter in the post in a week or so, so instead I'll call some towing places around Welly. It's a bit shitty actually and I have no idea how much it'll cost me. Wish my car was crap so I could say &quot;Just keep it, it's yours!&quot;</p>
<p>I want my dragster back (those of you who have actually seen the car understand what I mean by that - it's one hot metal machine I can tell you).</p>
<p>Anyone had their car towed before, or know what to do? I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 2007-04-23 09:54 - So it got towed to Barnett St by Te Papa. Looks like I can just go pick it up (with a fine attached to it). I asked <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/">Wellington City Council</a>, who put me through to ParkWise. I can't find an outside number for them though. Wish I'd have known all this last night. It sucks big time.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 2007-04-23 14:16 - Got the car back. $110 it'll cost me. But that's only $40 for the fine, a dastardly $70 for the tow around the corner. I'm in the wrong job :-)
