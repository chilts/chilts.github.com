<p>This past week, I didn't managed to write a huge amount for Macy Lights but today I played a whole lot of catchup.</p>
<p>One of my friends wondered if my inactivity was caused by me not being interested in my novel much or it being too hard but it reality it's quite the opposite. It was just a busy week, that's all, not to mention that a couple of nights were completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Regarding my novel, before today I really liked - now <strong>I absolutely love it</strong>. I knew that when I had the chance to start writing again that I would just spill my ideas out onto the keyboard and that's exactly what happened today. I was on 9.5k this morning and after doing 4.8k today I'm almost back up to where I should be (on a quota/day basis).</p>
<p>I read in one of the forums on the <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> site  the people were falling in love with their characters or their plot and I'm doing the same. I mentioned that the story had grown on me every single day since Oct 29th when I first had the idea. I liked it then and now I love it - which makes the whole thing a fantastically enjoyable thing to do.</p>
<p>Not to mention that I'll be meeting up with the other Wrimos in Wellington tomorrow which is also always great fun.</p>
<p>As always, every single day's writing is being posted on my <a href="/writing/macy-lights.html">Macy Lights and the Battle for Ashton's Gate</a> novel page. Today's is already up.
