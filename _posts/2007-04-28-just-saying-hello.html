<p>Things have been busy as usual. In short:</p>
<ul><li><strong>http://zaapt.org.nz (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> has had a lot of Account Admin done recently</li><li>I'm putting some finishing touches to a small part of <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a></li><li>I've developed another site (but not sure if it's going to be used)</li></ul>
<p>This weekend, I shall be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/jesse.shtml">mostly eating chickens</a>. Oh er, I mean, I shall be tieing up loose ends in blogs for Zaapt.
