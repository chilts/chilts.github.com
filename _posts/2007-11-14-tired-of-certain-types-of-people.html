<p>Not sure why, but there has been a lot of this recently.</p>
<p>
At the moment, I am tired of certain types of people who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>aren't grateful when you've done them a favour they explicitly asked for</li>
  <li>don't say thank you when you've given them something you know they enjoyed</li>
  <li>take your ideas and don't give you credit or acknowledge you</li>
  <li>criticise something you're trying to do even though they've <em>never attempted</em> anything like it themselves</li><li>reject something you're doing for the greater good, yet don't understand why you're doing it</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I see the bright side of things but there seems to be a lot of the above happening at the moment. This makes it all a lot harder but pushes me to do more of the same.</p>
<p>Now I'm just waiting for that thing someone does which will just blow me away, make me say &quot;wow, that was amazing&quot; and restore my confidence in the human race.
