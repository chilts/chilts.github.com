<p>I last posted here on 13th February which is altogether too long.</p>
<p>Anyway, just to let you know of a couple of things I've been up to recently. Of course, there are plenty of other things too but they'll have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>Firstly, I've been hacking on a small script which helps me generate static websites. Honestly, it is very small and it really does work. It's fast too, though I've only tried it with two fairly small sites so far.</p>
<p>The good thing is, it's data driven and uses templates to put everything together. It's called <strong>Blat</strong> and I'll probably put it on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> fairly soon (though I should try and put it on <a href="http://cpan.org/">CPAN</a>).</p>
<h2>New Site - Chilts.org</h2>
<p>The first example site I can show you is my new personal site called <a href="http://www.chilts.org">chilts.org</a>. It's not going to take over as my blog but it is going to start as both a first contact point for me personally and to also point to other places on the web that define me and who I am.</p>
<p>For example, I found out recently about the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tel">.tel</a> tld and once I figured out it was boring and of course chilton.tel was already gone, I decided to do my own site with more, better and nicely presented information.</p>
<p>Also, I thought it would be a good idea to have a place where I can link to everything else from. This also means that kapiti.geek.nz may get a future simplification.</p>
<h2>Planet Catalyst</h2>
<p>Finally, some of you may have noticed that I haven't posted this entry to <a href="http://planet.catalyst.net.nz/">Planet Catalyst</a>. The main reason is that it used to be a good place to put up some technical/geek articles and to get a somewhat larger audience. I'm sure the latter is true but I don't think the former is anymore. I fear the more technical articles are getting lost in amongst the non-technical ones (indeed, some articles are by people not even employed by Catalyst) which I don't really think was the original idea for the planet.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not against what the planet is now it just doesn't excite me as much as it used to and therefore I won't be posting to it. Maybe if it changes in the future but we'll see.</p>
<p>Until next time :)
