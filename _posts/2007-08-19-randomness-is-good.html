<p>You'd think that randomness, or pseudo-randomness, is something an electrical or software engineer is interested in. As it turns out, it's the life-blood for lots of people.</p>
<p>My brother, for example, would sometimes start stories with &quot;It was a bit of a random night...&quot; or &quot;We met some random where...&quot; etc etc</p>
<p>Well, today has been <em>very</em> random. Firstly, I woke up all happy and busy that I'd completed a fair chunk of work getting <a href="converting-kapiti-geek-nz-to-zaapt.html">the new kapiti.geek.nz</a> up and going (wait for tomorrow for the official launch).</p>
<p>Then I felt a bit weird that I was <a href="time-out.html">taking on too much</a> and that I needed a break. At that stage, I felt a bit down about a few things.</p>
<p>Then tonight, I've been out drinking, which is the first time in ages. Not my usual style and pretty random for me I can tell you. We (the <a href="http://wellington.pm.com/">Wellington Perlmongers</a> met up with <a href="http://dave.org.uk/">Dave Cross</a> (founder of the <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London PM</a> and his wife who are visiting New Zealand and happen to be coming by Wellington. They are both really nice and easy going and it was a pleasure to meet them both - I just hope they enjoyed their brief stay in Welly as much as we enjoyed their company.</p>
<p>It also seems that both <a href="http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/node/84">Andrew</a> and <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/2007/08/18/too_much_opensource.html">Brenda</a> have been checking out <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> and I hope that they found something of interest :-) While I know there are some weird things about it, if more people use Zaapt, those weird things will start to decrease. And also, the functionality will start to increase too (Lord knows, the documentation needs a lick or two).</p>
<p>Finally, as another random thing to add, I've had a couple of comments on this blog from <a href="http://kiwinewt.geek.nz/blog/">Nate</a> and I've added a few to his blog recently too. It's funny, I've never met him, but he seems like the kind of person I'd like to sit down with and chat to. Not sure about the whole <a href="http://kiwinewt.geek.nz/about.php">Bill Gates</a> comment though, but I guess everyone has their own type of weirdness along the way.</p>
<p>Oh, and Andrew, we all knew you were an extrovert from the start even if you didn't :-)
