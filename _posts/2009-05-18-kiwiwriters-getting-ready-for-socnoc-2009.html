<p>If you've ever wanted to challenge yourself to write a novel, then now is the perfect time to finally do it.</p>
<p>If you've ever said &quot;One day I'll write a novel&quot; then that day is June 1st, because on that day, over 100 people (maybe lots more) will all be starting theirs too.</p>
<p>50,000 words in a month is all it takes and you know what, after that you can boast that you have written that novel you always wanted to.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2009.html">SoCNoC challenge</a> and then <a href="http://www.kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">sign up</a> to the site to join.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> has also put out a <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0905/S00193.htm">press release</a> and everything is ramping up to the 3rd annual Southern Cross Novel Challenge!</p>
<p>What are you waiting for, sign up and let's get writing.</p>
<p>P.S. I have done <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> twice and also the first SoCNoC but I'm afraid I won't be writing another one this year. That doesn't stop you though :)
