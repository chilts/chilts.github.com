<p>Learning a bit about CAcert recently, I signed up immediately since it &quot;Just Makes Sense&quot;. Oh, and I can get an SSL certificate for my server too - for free.</p>
<p>Following on from Andrew's <a href="http://blog.etc.gen.nz/index.php?/archives/7-CAcert-Bandwagon.html">CAcert Bandwagon</a> entry, Catalyst IT will very soon (from tomorrow I think) have enough people to fully assure someone, anyone, everyone ... providing they have the relevant ID of course :-)</p>
<p>We'll be a good seed in Wellington to grow the number of assurers and get this <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert</a> wagon rolling in our area. Once we've reached these dizzy heights, we should try to get ourselves onto the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/AssurerGroups">Assurer Groups</a> page on the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/">CAcert Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>(P.S. Just found an entry on the <a href="http://blog.cacert.org/">CAcert News Blog</a> asking for assurers in <a href="http://blog.cacert.org/2006/08/159.html">Coventry UK</a> to help them kickstart their area. I might give them a shout since I'll be staying with my brother there in a month or so.)
