<p>Learning a bit about CAcert recently, I signed up immediately since it &quot;Just Makes Sense&quot;. Oh, and I can get an SSL certificate for my server too - for free.</p>
<p>Following on from Andrew's \[p]{CAcert Bandwagon|http://blog.etc.gen.nz/index.php?/archives/7-CAcert-Bandwagon.html} entry, Catalyst IT will very soon (from tomorrow I think) have enough people to fully assure someone, anyone, everyone ... providing they have the relevant ID of course :-)</p>
<p>We'll be a good seed in Wellington to grow the number of assurers and get this \[p]{CAcert|http://www.cacert.org/} wagon rolling in our area. Once we've reached these dizzy heights, we should try to get ourselves onto the \[p]{Assurer Groups|http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/AssurerGroups} page on the \[p]{CAcert Wiki|http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/}.</p>
<p>(P.S. Just found an entry on the \[p]{CAcert News Blog|http://blog.cacert.org/} asking for assurers in \[p]{Coventry UK|http://blog.cacert.org/2006/08/159.html} to help them kickstart their area. I might give them a shout since I'll be staying with my brother there in a month or so.)
