<p>After chatting with Travis and Penny, I truely believe that this is one of my best ever achievements.</p>
<p>A lot of people in this world have a list. A list of the 100 things they must do before they die. And in a lot of cases, that list has things like:</p>
<ul><li>run a marathon</li><li>do a parachute jump</li><li>climb a mountain</li><li>write a novel</li></ul>
<p>Out of that list above, I've done two of them - the first and last. Granted, I walked the final quarter of the Auckland marathon (the wind was against me, see!) but I still did it.</p>
<p>And you know what, doing <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> and fulfilling the fourth item on that list is about <em>50,000</em> times better than running a marathon. At least in my eyes!</p>
<p>So well done to the various people I know around Welly who have also finished it; it's been a great journey, an adventure, funny, hard, crazy, silly, tiring, awesome, completely bizarre and utterly enjoyable - I can't wait 'til next year.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/2006/11/nanowrimo-2006.html">Travis</a>'s and <a href="http://she.geek.nz/archives/331-holy-shit,-I-finished-nanowrimo.html">Penny</a>'s entries about finishing.</p>
<p>So thanks to Travis for pushing me and Penny for pulling me along these last 50,000 words! Phew. I need some sleep.</p>
<p>P.S. I don't have a list of 100 things to do before I die, but if I did, NaNoWriMo would be one of them.
