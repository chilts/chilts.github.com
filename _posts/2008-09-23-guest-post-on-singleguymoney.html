A few days ago, SingleGuyMoney asked if <a href="http://www.singleguymoney.com/2008/09/im-leaving-on-jet-plane.html">anyone would like to do a guest post</a>. I duly responded and today my guest post has appeared.
</p>

<p>
It's called <a href="http://www.singleguymoney.com/2008/09/being-green-and-how-it-saves-you-money.html">Being Green and How it Saves You Money</a>. I hope you guys enjoy it and be sure to leave a comment either over there or over here with other tips on how being green can save you money.
