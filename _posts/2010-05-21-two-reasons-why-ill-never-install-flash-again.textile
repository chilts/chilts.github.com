The first is pretty obvious. Now that I can watch YouTube using HTML5 features that means Flash is one step away from being chucked out forever.

And after reading this blog entry about the Google Maps API v3, Flash - as far as I'm concerned - is now out of the window. I didn't realise but hidden in amongst a lot of other text are the words "The most significant change is that Street View is entirely implemented in HTML...":http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2010/05/they-grow-up-so-fast.html.

I thought "No, surely not", so I kept double clicking the map until I was sufficiently zoomed in to see 'Pegman' and I moved him onto the road. Sure enough, in my non-Flash versions of both Chrome and Firefox I could see Street View. After twisting the view around, clicking up and down the street I was wondering to myself "I have no freakin' idea how they did this, but I'm glad they did". If you haven't noticed already, I think the Flash version of Street View had two levels of zoom, well this one seems to have 5 or 6.

So yes, I'm a happy bunny tonight. Add this to the fact that GitHub also reimplemented their "network graph":http://github.com/blog/621-bye-bye-flash-network-graph-is-now-canvas a few months ago using the Canvas element, the future is looking decidedly bright (and very HTML5-CSS3-like).
