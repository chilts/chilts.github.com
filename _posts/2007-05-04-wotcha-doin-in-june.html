<p>If you've ever thought about writing a novel, then now's the time to do it. Otherwise, you never will.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, we over at <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> are planning on writing a 50,000 word novel  this coming June.</p>
<p>It starts on the 1st, it ends on the 30th and the only goal is to write 50,000 words - which is basically a short novel. I've done it before so I'll be writing my 2nd novel and I can tell you, it's one of the best feelings in the world.</p>

<p>If you've ever thought that you'd like to write a novel, this is the perfect opportunity to start along with a group of very enthusiastic people, all there together for moral support. Remember, if you don't do it <strong>now</strong>, you never will.</p>
