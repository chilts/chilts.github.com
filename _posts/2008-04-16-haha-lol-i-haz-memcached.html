<p>Quote from Port 25, a blog which describes itself as &quot;Communication from the Open Source Community at Microsoft&quot;.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2008/04/memcached_simple_works_best_ta.html">this post</a> from the Port 25 blog, it says:</p>
<blockquote>Oh, but wait, what is memcached? memcached is really nothing more than a cache service for accessing data. Its origins are as a cache service for the RDBMS used by Facebook.</blockquote>
<p>If you think that's true, then you don't deserve to have it. That's is all.</p>
<p>(BTW, the link in their very first paragraph to <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">Danga</a> states in the second paragraph that it was originally developed for LiveJournal, which we all knew.)</p>
