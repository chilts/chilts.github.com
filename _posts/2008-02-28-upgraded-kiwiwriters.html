<p>After a few months of intense development and procrastination (yes, you can have both) I've finally upgraded KiwiWriters.</p>
<p>It's been a long haul. The last time <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> was updated was <strong>way</strong> before a number of changes that have been made to Zaapt. I won't go through all the details, but here's a rundown of the technologies that have changed under the hood.</p>
<ul><li>changed OS from Debian Sarge to Etch</li><li>upgraded from Apache 1.3 to Apache 2</li><li>Postgres 7.4 to 8.1</li><li>an earlier Zaapt version to Zaapt 0.1 rc1</li></ul>
<p>I know there are a few things I've missed but I plan on fixing those up over the weekend. It was about time I just did it rather than wait around anymore. Also, it's not a mission critical site (and it's volunteer work) so it gets as much time as it gets because no-one's paying for it :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad to have finally done it because this means KiwiWriters is now using <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> v0.1 and now I can start of development for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/list?q=milestone:Release0.2">v0.2</a>.</p>
<p>Excellent news :-)
