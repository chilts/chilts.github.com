<p>So I did it on Saturday and had to wait until Tuesday evening to deploy.</p>
<p>As you know, my server hosting company took the Mick and had routing problems for 4 days. It's hard to go over and fix it yourself when you are in New Zealand and they are in Denmark,</p>
<p>Anyways, now that I have access to my server again (and hence my web admin, my email, my SVN and other stuff) I have updated the site to add trackbacks.</p>
<p>Currently, the DB changes have been made, the site calls the Perl Modules at the backend to display the trackbacks, the admin displays and audits them, so the only thing left to do is publish the trackback link for each entry...</p>
<p>...but I'm going to use this \[p]{trackback form|http://www.reedmaniac.com/scripts/trackback_form.php} first to test it all out.
