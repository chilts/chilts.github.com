<p>The following article made me smile.</p>
<p>I don't necessarily agree with all of it, but a lot of it is true. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2008/03/the_worthlessness_of_code.html">The Worthlessness of Code</a>.</p>
<p>I especially agree with the bit about having to re-write it every so often. We work in an industry where bit-rot means we have to replenish everything we do faster than in any other industry (and yes, I know that's a generalised term).</p>
<p>Quick aside: on the subject of small blog posts like this one, I really should get a Tumblelog up and going.
