<p>For some reason, I've been a bit down the last few days. Not sure why.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's because I saw some of my family at the weekend for the last time in a while.</p>
<p>I know there are a few other things niggling in the back of my mind which I'm not sure what to do with. Also, I think after being really productive for basically the first half of this year, ending with a novel in June, I just need a break for a while.</p>
<p>Also the things I'm meant to be doing are just really hard and I can't find a solution for them yet.</p>
<p>Oh, you know on LiveJournal when people post blog entries, they can also put in their current mood. Well mine at the moment is <strong>tired, frustrated and not quite so happy</strong>.</p>
<p>Bollocks to that, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning all refreshed and just ride it out.
