<p>After almost, but not quite, 3 months of development, Zaapt now has to move on, grow up and leave home.</p>
<p>This blog has been a lot about Zaapt recently and it's about time it went back to it's varied but still technical days. Zaapt has been lopped off.</p>
<p>But don't worry, it wasn't hurt. Instead, <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt has found a new home</a>. In fact, it has found TWO new homes - the other being <a href="http://simple.zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt Simple</a>. There might also be a 3rd on the way.</p>
<p>All these sites, along with <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">Kiwi Writers</a> demonstrate the power that Zaapt already has. Even though Zaapt is still in it's infancy there is enough functionality to demonstrate fully working sites - aided by the fact that <a href="zaapt-now-has-menus.html">menus</a> had just been added.</p>
<p>There is some information on the new site already but it only started a few hours ago. Over time the content will grow, just like the Zaapt CMS did. So from now on, Zaapt news and developments will be posted there with an occasional prod from me here if something major is happening.</p>
<p>It seems there are a few big adventures I am currently journeying on! Long may it continue.</p>
