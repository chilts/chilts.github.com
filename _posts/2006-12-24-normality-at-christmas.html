<p>After it being a bit mad the past few months, I'm hoping for normality at Christmas and beyond.</p>
<p>It seems I never get that much time for myself these days. Certainly, the past few months has been a bit of a mad time that's for sure as mustard.</p>
<p>Now, I don't usually make New Year's resolutions since I think if you want to change something in your life, you should just do it rather than do it when the rest of world does or because someone says so.</p>
<p>The funny thing being is that there is something I do want to change this year and it just so happens it is almost New Year - I know, I had to make an excuse didn't I?</p>
<p>So what am I going to change? Lately as I said earlier, I've had lots to do and it seems, not much time. I'm going to try and change that.</p>
<p>I want a bit more time to myself. Time to relax and time to do what I want, when I want. I also want to meet up with friends a bit more. To be honest, I am going to have more hours in the day anyway since I have just moved a lot closer to work so that will definately help.</p>
<p>I'm currently away for Christmas and I've been chilling out and relaxing. Reading a book before I switch the light off is something I should do more of but don't. To be honest, I usually end up thinking about something or making something, which means my brain is still wired and I can't sleep (another problem area of mine). These past few days I've slept a lot better so again, that's something I want to change.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that I can chill a bit more in the New Year like I am over Christmas. I know I have organised a number of things over the next two weeks but after that...I hope...it'll calm down for a while!
