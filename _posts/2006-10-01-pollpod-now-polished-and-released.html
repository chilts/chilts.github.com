<p>...or should that be 'Unleashed'</p>
<p>About a year ago, I wrote a progam called PollPod which I uploaded to \[p]{SourceForge|http://sourceforge.net/}. It did what I wanted and more, but with not really liking the SF interface and the fact that I didn't have an MP3 player, I let it rot. A little, okay, maybe a lot.</p>
<p>Since I bought my Sandisk Sansa e270, I decided to give it a bit of spit and polish and resurrect it for use on my new toy. Now it is simpler, has a proper manual and even better than all that, has Debian packaging :-)</p>
<p>So I had registered the PollPod name at \[p]{Google Code|http://code.google.com/p/pollpod/} (and accepted the transfer from SF (which worked fine). After a few days of cleaning up and clearing out, I have now uploaded v0.1 and created a branch and tag for it - oh how \[p]{Subversion|http://subversion.tigris.org/} is <strong>so</strong> nice compared to CVS.</p>
<p>Anyways, head over to the previously mentioned Google Code page or take a look at the \[p]{PollPod Discuss|http://groups.google.com/group/pollpod-discuss} or \[p]{PollPod Commit|http://groups.google.com/group/pollpod-comit} lists.</p>
<p>Right then. After a good day of getting myself together and uploading it all, I'm off to listen to \[p]{Chris Evans|http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/evans/podcast/}!
