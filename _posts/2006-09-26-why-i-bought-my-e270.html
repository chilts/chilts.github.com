<p>I didn't want an iPod, that's why.</p>
<p>For a while I waited since I wanted to get one of the new Sandisk Sansa e270's, but still it didn't seem to come out and it was a bit pricey. I held out since they looked so much better than the iPod Nanos.</p>
<p>But now it seems that they went a bit far and from this article on \[p]{Engadget|http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/22/sandisk-wants-you-to-say-idont-to-ipod/} I found that they had created a site called \[p]{iDont.com|http://idont.com}. Personally, I chose to go against iPod for my own reasons though I don't think they should say it themselves since, as the Engadget article says, it smacks of being a poor loser - not that they are, since I think eventually they will catch up on Apple (though probably never take over).</p>
<p>As for the site, I don't have Flash installed so basically my opinion of it is fairly low. And who thinks the little monster thing looks like the \[p]{Telecom|http://telecom.co.nz} mascot (sorry, can't find the picture I want).</p>
<p>Added to the fact that they wrote it in PHP...\[p]{need I say more|http://www.lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/68-PHP-Sucks..html}.
