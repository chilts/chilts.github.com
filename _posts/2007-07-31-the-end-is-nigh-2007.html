<p>There is a new challenge over at KiwiWriters - go check it out if you want to finish that thing off you've been meaning to do for ages.</p>
<p><a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/the-end-is-nigh-2007.html">The End is Nigh</a> challenge aims at getting you to finish off whatever it is you've been procrastinating about all this time. You know you have one or two, or five or six, things you've been meaning to finish off, but you just need that momentum to get you started.</p>
<p>This is your excuse to finish off whatever it is you've just not had chance to do. The best part about it though, is that you'll be finishing things off with lots of other people to push you, cheer you on and also who are doing it themselves, so you're not alone.</p>
<p>I shall be finishing off my NaNoWriMo novel from last year - <strong>The Bright Side of Casey Hill</strong> - as well as my SoCNoC novel from this year - <strong>Bit and Byte's Adventure</strong>.</p>
<p>And some people seem to have <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/2007/07/end-really-is-nigh.html">already started</a>, so what are you waiting for, <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">Join Us</a> and let's just get it finished.
</p>
