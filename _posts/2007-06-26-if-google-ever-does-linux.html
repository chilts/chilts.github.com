<p>For ages and ages, people have said that Google will do 'their own' Linux. But the question is, why will they do it and will it work?</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, if <a href="http://www.osweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2587&amp;Itemid=449">Google ever does their own Linux</a>, then I don't think it will make as big a splash as everyone makes out it will. Let's look at some history of Linux distros I think are applicable here and we'll see why it won't work.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Sun announced the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">Java Desktop</a>. Yes, it was aimed at big multinational corporations but really, how much of a dint did it make. Sun's reason for making it - push Java onto everyone, no matter what they said back then, that was the plan. In reality, no-one at home wanted it and let's face it, the geeks rule this nest and that's why it didn't catch on.</p>
<p>Lindows, then renamed to <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a>, have had some success but their message was - &quot;Let's make Linux like Windows&quot;. Again, the geeks don't want it even though it's not aimed at them, so it will eventually fail.</p>
<p>SuSe (under Novell) now seem directed at the &quot;let's work with Windows&quot; thing. Yes, this will fail to, for the same reasons as above and the fact that they dumped a whole pile of sh*t on themselves. Oh, and the geeks don't trust Novell anymore.</p>
<p>Linux distros don't succeed if they aim at the corporate world, especially the corporate desktop, at least not yet anyway.</p>
<p>But then, neither do they succeed if they aim at the non-technical home user, as Linspire shows.</p>
<p>However, what does work are the general purpose Linux distros that can be put to a multitude of tasks and don't force you to go in one direction. Debian, Ubuntu and Redhat all fall into this category and they are the most successful of all (to varying degrees of whatever your successful means). Any of these distros can be put to use on the corporate desktop, the corporate server, the slightly technical home user and all kinds of uses for the most important, the geeks. Ubuntu claims the crown of the most diverse uses with it's certified server editions, LTS editions and it's desktop editions and it is this distro which looks most likely to succeed on the corporate desktop too.</p>
<p>So let's get back to what will Google do with 'their' Linux?</p>
<p>That's easy - they want you to use the internet.</p>
<p>For searching, for <a href="http://gmail.com/">email</a>, for storing your documents, your <a href="http://google.com/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a> and <a href="http://google.com/notebook/">notes</a>, your <a href="http://google.com/calendar/">diary</a>, your contacts and pretty soon, almost everything you ever wished for, including word processing, spreadsheet and presentation <a href="http://docs.google.com/">documents</a>.</p>
<p>And this applies to both home users and the corporate world, as their <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">apps</a> prove - already being used for large universities and other organisations.</p>
<p>So to have all of this internet stuff going on, what will they do?</p>
<p>They will make the browser the number one application in the distro, that's what. I would even think that they will build in a remote data store and remote backup (to their servers of course) to get into the realm of your personal documents too. For example, what about storing your photos (<a href="http://picasa.google.com/">they've already done that</a>) or your music collection (what this space). How about your videos (a variation of <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> anyone)?</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the rest of the imaginary 'Google Linux'?</p>
<p>Well, it means that it'll be cut down. Or at least it'll cut things out. I mean, why would they put a native email client on there when they want you to use Gmail? Why would they install OpenOffice if you can use their online docs? And why would you even put your bookmarks in your browser if they can do that for you too!</p>
<p>Maybe they <em>will</em> let you do these things but my guess is that they won't be installed by default and of course, only the more experienced bods will be able to install them anyway. This leaves everyone else using the Google OS as a proxy to the Google services and it'll be like AOL taking over your computer all over again.</p>
<p>Therefore, in conclusion, I think if Google ever do an OS of their own it will go two ways depending on how they push it. If they push it like above, then it will fail. The geeks won't like it (and let's face it, they're already divided about Google anyway). If they make it generic, add some niceties and maybe even <em>with</em> lots of goodies to interact with their services, then I think it will succeed. If the geeks like it (which Google does aim to please), then it will work.</p>
<p>I do hope they don't push their own services too far at the expense of the rest, that's all I'm saying. Personally, I like Google and their services but I just hope they don't try to become both the computer AND the internet, otherwise people will move on. We're very fickle you know :-)
