<p>SoCNoC is not yet 5 days old but already we're nearing half a million collective words. Obviously over time, people will either finish, slow down or drop out but so far it's been amazing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I put a collective word count onto the front page of <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> so everyone could see our total. Not that I'm contributing much - am still only on 1,283 - but I hope things will settle down and I can get writing again to help push that total higher.</p>
<p>Last year we <em>almost</em> made one million words for the whole month so we're well on the way to smashing that figure. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>We hit a different record on Sunday too, managing to get 3,600 hits in a single day. And the next day we smashed it again with over 4,300 hits on a single day. It's a belter!</p>
<p>I apologise to those people who don't find these figures as interesting as I do so unless we manage even more amazing facts and figures, I'll keep them to myself (yeah, right). Maybe I'll post some totals at the end of the month.
