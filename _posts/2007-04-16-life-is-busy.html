<p>For whatever reason (and there are a few), life has become somewhat busy. It's not like at the start of this year, when it was manically busy - instead, it's a good type of busy.</p>
<p>It seems that I have to juggle quite a few things at the moment, both $work and !$work. Instead of settling into one big project, or even two, I have a number of things on the go.</p>
<p>I'm not telling about $work though.</p>
<p>Instead, here's some things I've been juggling at home. I seem to be hitting <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> every now and again. I did a three-week stint up until a week ago, but it seems that there is always more to do. I'm trying to give it my due attention, but at the same time, sometimes I feel it's a lot of work for a smallish site. It will get bigger though - promise.</p>
<p>I have also been hacking <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> a lot, in fact, quite a lot this week. I also have more interest in it but this time I think it'll go a bit further than the nibbles I've already had and a site will appear sometime soon - watch this space.</p>
<p>My plan for Zaapt now is to get a v0.1 out there, but that is still about one or two months away (let's say three for good measure). It' not that it can't be used already - oh no, most of the content management stuff is ready. It's moreso the administration side of things which have been shouting for more user attention instead of me hacking the database.</p>
<p>In the near future, I have plans to implement two new sites and further down the line, another site for a friend of mine. She obviously thinks I'm slacking, or at least, not developing it. As it turns out, it'll be using pretty much everything Zaapt has to offer, so hopefully all this work will pay off.</p>
<p>Anyway, nice to check in witchyer! Laters.
