<p>NaNoWriMo isn't all about writing a 50,000 word novel in a month, it's all about random stuff too. Like podcasts.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/2007/11/wellington-wrimos-on-nanomonkeys.html">Kerryn</a> organising the Wellington NaNoWriMo Kick-Off meeting, we had <a href="http://whispers.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=277351">Phillipa Ballantine</a> come along and interview us for a <a href="http://www.teampodcasts.net/nanomonkeys/2007/11/12/day-12/">NaNoMonkeys</a> podcast.</p>
<p>I love it the way they say we're from middle earth. Anyway, you can get to hear me on there once or twice. I'm one of the two English accents you can hear and in some people's minds, the funny accent.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a fun gathering and hopefully we'll see Pip later in the month or at the Thank God It's Over Party.
