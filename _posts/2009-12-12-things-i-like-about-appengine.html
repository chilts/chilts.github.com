<p>SO far, I've been enjoying playing with <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">AppEngine</a>. It's been a long process for me, since I've been learning Python at the same time, but very productive I think.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd give a quick list about what I like about AppEngine. However, please not that very soon I'll also be doing a &quot;What I Don't Like about AppEngine&quot;.</p>
<ul><li>quick and easy development environment (one command to start the server listening on a local port)</li><li>simple deployment process (one command to upload the application, update indexes and task queues)</li><li>versioning on the server side, so you can run something like 'stable' and 'experimental' all against the same datastore</li><li>simple logging, <code>import logging</code> then they capture any <code>logging.info()</code> etc statements into the AppEngine console</li><li>sending email is pretty easy too <code>mail.send_mail(to, from, subject, body)</code> makes it nice and simple to alert someone</li><li>no sysadmin maintenance to do! This is a big bonus for me not having to keep servers up to date</li></ul>
<p>... and finally, this isn't really a feature of the platform, but just being allowed to play around with a schemaless datastore has been a whole heap of fun.</p>
<h2>Other Sites for Lollysite</h2>
<p>I also thought I'd mention that <a href="/project/lollysite/">Lollysite</a> is now being used for both <a href="/">chilts.org</a> and the new <a href="http://kohacon.appspot.com/">KohaCon</a> sites. In fact, to get the other theme going wasn't really that hard but better than that, I didn't actually have to change that much in Lollysite itself.
