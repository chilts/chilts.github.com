This was quite a big one. I was only just half asleep when this one hit. It lasted about 10 or 15 seconds though it did give the bed a fairly good shake.</pre>
<p>I had a look at <a href="http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/2737984g.html">Geonet</a> as I usually do and realised that they'd updated the site. Nice. Ah but wait, now 2 of my 3 old links don't work. That's very annoying - really, if you re-arrange your site, please make the old URLs forward to the new location. Rah!
