<p>Since April, it seems that there has been constant raining - but today is
nice.</p>
<p>Which gives me the impetus to head out and finally get started on my
<strong>wpow</strong>. That means <strong>Wellington Picture of the Week</strong>. Now, I'm not going
to post a picture every week, nor will it be of Wellington necessarily (and
once it has been happening for a while, no-one will remember what <strong>wpow</strong>
means anyway.</p>
<p>So yeah...laters.</p>
