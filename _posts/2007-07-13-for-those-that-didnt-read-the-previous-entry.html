<p>I'm much happier today. 'Twas a good day.</p>
<p>Got many things done, sussed out a few things, made a number of things and generally just enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>Two of the things that had been on my mind yesterday have cleared up. There is still one or two other things nagging me, one of which is easily fixed, the other I'm not sure - but don't worry, it's nothing major, just a little hill I have to get over.
