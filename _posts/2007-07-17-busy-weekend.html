<p>The thing about Welly is, it's just so damn good.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, I met up with a friend and headed off to see (hear?) the <a href="http://www.nzso.co.nz/the_concerts/subscription_tours/subscription_tour_4#serie1">NZSO</a>. I really liked the Mendelssohn and she really liked the Sibelius, especially the last one (her opinion counts <em>so</em> much more than mine though).</p>
<p>On Saturday I met up with a couple of friends for coffee late afternoon, then with a larger other group for dinner (including <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a>, <a href="http://jason-pollock.blogspot.com/">Jason</a> and <a href="http://loveinatent.blogspot.com/">Michelle</a>). We had lovely food at <a href="http://www.wellingtonnz.com/RestaurantsAndShopping/Restaurants/Strawberry+Fare+-+Dessert+Restaurant/Strawberry+Fare+-+Dessert+Restaurant.htm">Strawberry Fare</a>, went to see <a href="http://www.eventfinder.co.nz/2007/jul/wellington/carl-barron2.html">Carl Barron</a> and went back to Strawberry Fare for desert.</p>
<p>Sunday, a couple of other friends and I did a short version of the <a href="http://www.feelinggreat.co.nz/walking/walking-tracks-and-walk-ways/8662-southern-walkway.php">Southern Walkway</a> and then we just chilled with coffee in Newtown afterwards.</p>
<p>Then last night, <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a> and I went to a dancing lesson at <a href="http://www.wellingtonrnr.org.nz/">Wellington Rock 'n' Roll Revival Club</a>. It was my first ever lesson and yes, it was good fun, in fact, it was excellent. Thanks Kerryn.</p>
<p>Can it get any better than this?
