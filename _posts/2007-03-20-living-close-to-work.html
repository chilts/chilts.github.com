<p>You guys may have noticed that I have been doing a lot recently - due to one thing...having more time.</p>
<p>Living up the coast, a good three hours each day to/from work was good but very time consuming. Now, I live about 5 minutes from work. Some people don't like living that close - I think it's great.</p>
<p>I get so much more time each and every single day that I can get lots and lots more stuff done. I am sleeping more and therefore sleeping well. I have started exercising again. I am helping people do stuff and am also doing more for myself. It's amazing what you can come up with.</p>
<p>I also come home at lunch, which means I can do other chores - like the washing up, washing, tidying and because I have to be back at work, I just do it in little 15 minute stints. A bit strange, but it does mean I don't have to do it in the evening or the weekend - another time saver.</p>
<p>At the moment, I feel so refreshed doing all this stuff. I'm also going to enrol on an evening course of some sort, but not quite sure what it'll be yet. Should be fun!
