<p>The roots of Open Source lie in Academia and Scientific Papers and Peer review.</p>
<p><a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> pulled <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Nov/30/shields/">this quote about Open Source</a> from an article by <a href="http://daveshields.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/xo-laptop-on-the-open-sourcing-of-business/">Dave Shields</a>.</p>
<p>I love it, though my favourite quote from it is:</p>
<blockquote>As a programmer, it [Open Source Software] is the best arena in which to work.</blockquote>
<p>P.S. my blog entries are not usually this short so I now need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog">Tumblelog</a> for such things. Time permitting, I shall be implementing a (initially small) Tumblelog model for <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz">Zaapt</a> in December.
