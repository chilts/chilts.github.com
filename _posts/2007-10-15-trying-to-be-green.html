<p>It seems that no matter what you do and how hard you try, you can always be greener.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel I don't do enough to be green. Mostly I think I'm okay but in reality there are many many more things I can do to help out.</p>
<p>Here is some of the things I do, I've started doing recently or I want to do more of in the future. I'm going to centre on <strong>Reduce, Re-use, Recycle</strong> and public transport.</p>
<h2>Reduce</h2>
<p>This is the area I can probably do most in. Not that I'm bad but I feel I can do a lot more mainly by buying less! It's that simple. My main problem is food since I eat out a lot. I really should buy in more and eat at home more (but that's no fun).</p>
<h2>Re-Use</h2>
<p>Recently I got reusable shopping bags. Erm, can't think of anything else. Oh, I re-use water bottles instead of buying a new one all the time. I really should use my proper bottle.</p>
<h2>Recycling</h2>
<p>I recycle paper, glass and metals every week (thanks to the council picking them up). I took my old computers to Wellington's <a href="http://www.eday.org.nz/about-eday.asp#resultstable">eDay</a> recently and I usually give old clothes to various charities for re-use or re-sell.</p>
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>I walked to school everyday from the age of 9 to 18. At university I always took public transport. I have always used public transport to work (except on the odd occassion I take the car).</p>
<p>I love trains, have a love-hate relationship with buses and wish Wellington would get proper trams (those silly old trolly-buses don't count).</p>
<p>My car doesn't guzzle gas, I despise the people around town who have 4x4's for no good reason and I really should get peddle cycle.</p>
<p>I will be moving closer to work at some stage in the future, for both the environment and so I get more hours in the day. Then, I'll feel like cooking at home in the evening and I might even be able to go home at lunchtime - which I did do for a while and it certainly means I eat healthier, cheaper and create less waste.</p>
<p>So, that's about it for me. But finally... this article was written because today is <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>.
