<p>For what will be a great spectacle, Mercury is passing right in front of the sun for the 2nd time (of 14) this century!</p>
<p>Having never seen a transit of anything before (Mercury and Venus being the only two we can see from earth), I'm really wanting to buy myself a telescope and solar filter to take a look.</p>
<p>New Zealand is in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6121822.stm">privileged position</a> of being able to see the entire thing from Contact I though to Contact IV (<a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/OH/transit06.html">a good explanation of contacts</a>).</p>
<p>If my timezone calculations aren't completely off, it should be occuring between 08:12 and 13:10 tomorrow, Thursday 9th November.</p>
<p>Now go out and have a look (but not without a proper filter). You won't be able to see if with your naked eye, but a small telescope should be big enough (again, DO NOT look at it without a proper solar filter)!</p>
<p>After having seen the <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEmono/TSE1999/TSE1999.html">1999 solar eclipse</a> from a location giving totality , I find anything to do with the sun to be pretty amazing. At that time, I was working at <a href="http://www.esa.int/spacecraftops/index.html">ESOC</a> on <a href="http://www.esa.int/spacecraftops/ESOC-Article-fullArticle_item_selected-6_12_00_par-33_1069167510361.html">XMM-Newton</a> so that made it extra special. BTW: we did our LEOP procedures from the <a href="http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/esoc/virtualtour/content_full.html">control room</a>.</p>
<p>But still, my favourite things about the sun is the images that <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/">SOHO</a> has been taking.
