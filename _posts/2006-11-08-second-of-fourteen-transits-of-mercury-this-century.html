<p>For what will be a great spectacle, Mercury is passing right in front of the sun for the 2nd time (of 14) this century!</p>
<p>Having never seen a transit of anything before (Mercury and Venus being the only two we can see from earth), I'm really wanting to buy myself a telescope and solar filter to take a look.</p>
<p>New Zealand is in the \[p]{privileged position|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6121822.stm} of being able to see the entire thing from Contact I though to Contact IV (\[p]{a good explanation of contacts|http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/OH/transit06.html}).</p>
<p>If my timezone calculations aren't completely off, it should be occuring between 08:12 and 13:10 tomorrow, Thursday 9th November.</p>
<p>Now go out and have a look (but not without a proper filter). You won't be able to see if with your naked eye, but a small telescope should be big enough (again, DO NOT look at it without a proper solar filter)!</p>
<p>After having seen the \[p]{1999 solar eclipse|http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEmono/TSE1999/TSE1999.html} from a location giving totality , I find anything to do with the sun to be pretty amazing. At that time, I was working at \[p]{ESOC|http://www.esa.int/spacecraftops/index.html} on \[p]{XMM-Newton|http://www.esa.int/spacecraftops/ESOC-Article-fullArticle_item_selected-6_12_00_par-33_1069167510361.html} so that made it extra special. BTW: we did our LEOP procedures from the \[p]{control room|http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/esoc/virtualtour/content_full.html}.</p>
<p>But still, my favourite things about the sun is the images that \[p]{SOHO|http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/} has been taking.
