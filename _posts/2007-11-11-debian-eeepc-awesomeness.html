<p>Good news for the Asus EeePC - in my eyes at least.</p>
<p>After I got my shiny new <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/en/product.htm">Asus EeePC</a> last week I knew a community to put their own Linux distro on it would grow around it soon enough.</p>
<p>The OS that comes pre-installed is a Xandros-based system and while I'm happy with it now, I'll eventually replace it.  Lots of people have already installed Ubuntu on it, though they had to use <code>ndiswrapper</code> for the Wi-Fi (new Atheros chipset apparently) and also suspend doesn't quite work yet.</p>
<p>Lots of people have also been adding both Debian repositories and Xandros repositories on the assumption that they will work, but there are also reports that some things stop working. I'm also not convinced that they'll be completely compatible.</p>
<p>But there is good news on the horizon. I thought a community to port Ubuntu properly onto the EeePC would crop up first but already <a href="http://syn.theti.ca/">Ben Armstrong</a> has stepped up to the plate with his <a href="http://debian-eeepc.alioth.debian.org/">Debian-EeePC</a> project.</p>
<p>Happy happy joy joy! I can't wait.
