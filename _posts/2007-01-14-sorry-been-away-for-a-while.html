<p>I've been head down in writing my new CMS and the new site for ProjectX...just wait and see, it's going to be great.</p>
<p>After a number of weeks with my head in the laptop (like your head being in a book, but slightly different), I've made great strides in the functionality of the new CMS and the first site which will use it. There are page types for content managed pages, blogs (50% done), news, FAQs, Forums (90% done) and accounts (25% done).</p>
<p>For those wanting a sneak peak of the CMS, take a look at <a href="/software/zaapt.html">Zaapt Home</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Zaapt Project Home</a>.</p>
<p>As for ProjectX, I have 2 more things to implement before we can go live. I want to add some Profile information for each account and then I can get started on a few added extras specific to the site itself.</p>
<p>I'm really, really dieing to tell you all about it but I can't yet. Once we do an official launch, then I'll be able to write something here. Let's just say I'm excited and I think the rest of the group are too.
