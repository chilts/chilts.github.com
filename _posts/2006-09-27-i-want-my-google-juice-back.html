<p>About a month ago my server had network problems and I lost my Google Juice. Now I want it back.</p>
<p>For about 4 days my site was inaccessible and straight away Google showed that there were less pages indexed from my site. At the moment of course, I have very modest statics since the site has only been going a couple of months, but it said at one stage that about 50 pages were indexed.</p>
<p>A few days ago, it said that about 20 pages were being indexed and now it's up to 30.</p>
<p>There may be another reason for this though and I suspect my server outage was a bit of a red-herring. In between these times I have been away and had only updated my blog the once, so I suspect that was also partly (mostly?) to blame.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is &quot;though shalt update the website regularly&quot; - which we all kinda knew anyway. Best to learn it the hard way I suppose.</p>
<p>P.S. Just found the term &quot;Google Juice&quot; on <a href="http://narnia.bounceme.net/jeremy/2006/09/27/downtime/">Jeremy Visser</a>'s blog which prompted me to write this.
