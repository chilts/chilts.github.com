<p>I've been waiting until the end of my current contract until I make the news official - though I've hardly been hiding it.</p>
<pre>
Some of you (and now \l{Jason|/random/openid-presentation.html#comments}) already know that I shall be returning to Catalyst to work, some of you don't know and besides, it's already \l{out there|http://she.geek.nz/archives/432-complete-failure-to-update.html} anyway - hi pennypants, you beat me by a day :-)</pre>
<p>So yep, today was my last day contracting but to be honest, I'm not going to talk about it much, except to say that I now know where I am meant to be.</p>
<p>When I left Catalyst before Christmas, it was because of the pull of the new place rather than because I wanted to leave. Maybe it was a rash decision (hindsight eh!) but these things happen. Yes, there were a few other factors but nothing in this life is simple. So instead of seeing out my current contract, I decided to make a decision and go with it - I'm fairly headstrong when I make a decision. I spoke to one of the Catalyst directors a few weeks ago and I said &quot;I'd love to come back, I miss the place and the people too much.&quot; He replied &quot;We'd love to have you back&quot; and that was that, decision made.</p>
<p>Ignoring many (many) things that contribute towards work and a workplace, two things stuck out in my mind as being quite important to me. Yes there are other factors, but as I said, I'm ignoring those here.</p>
<p>The first is that, within Catalyst, it's the IT staff who make the decisions because first and foremost the company creates software. Unlike many other places of work the geeks come first - I obviously like that being a programmer and all. For example, in many other organisations (think banks et al) the geeks are just overhead trying to keep things ticking over so that <em>other</em> people can do their work.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't like being an overhead.</p>
<p>Secondly, one of the things I miss the most is the Open Source world. You knew that right? There is <strong>so</strong> much going on, things you can play with, learn, use open standards (which always comes in handy), new technologies spring up all the time and to top it all off it has some of the brightest people I have <em>ever</em> worked with. I feel it's a constant learning curve with so much to know and everyone is always willing to help.</p>
<p>It just creates a really nice atmosphere and <a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst</a> pretty much embodies the Open Source world to which I feel such an attachment.</p>
<p>Recently, I started a CMS called <strong>http://zaapt.org.nz/ (deprecated) Zaapt</strong> and knew from the start that I would give it away freely as open source. I may never make any money off this thing and God knows I've put enough hours into it but that's missing the point. I have worked with and enjoyed using other people's software for many years, which they too also open sourced, and I feel that giving back to the community is the right thing to do. Hopefully Zaapt will get bigger so that many other people use it (fingers crossed) and only then I can feel my contribution back to the Open Source community has helped.</p>
<p>So, I have a week off to chill out and go see some family, and I'll be starting on the 25th June. Maybe by then I'll have finished my <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">novel</a> too.
