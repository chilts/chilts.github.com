<p>After just one week of SoCNoC, I'm already 25% done!</p>
<p>After one week of NaNoWriMo, I'd probably only does a few thousand words, but now I'm sitting pretty on over 12,500.</p>
<p>This year is so amazing so far. I've pretty much been living and breathing the <a href="http://KiwiWriters.org">KiwiWriters</a> site for 6 months or so now and just having it all come together is fantastic. It's beyond all our expectations so far and I'm sure this is going to continue.</p>
<p>We now have:</p>
<ul><li>56 participants</li><li>average of 2,000 hits per day</li><li>collectively written almost 300,000 words - that million is definitely possible</li></ul>
<p>So all in all, it's great so far and I hope it'll get better as the month wears on.
