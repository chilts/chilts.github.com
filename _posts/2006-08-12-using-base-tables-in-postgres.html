title: Using Base Tables in PostgreSQL

<p>Sometimes object inheritance gets in the way, sometimes it helps. In this case, a small bit of inheritance for tables in Postgres really helps.</p>
<p>Let's say you require all of your tables to contain columns of the same name and type. As an example, in a number of my Postgres databases, I like to have an <code>inserted</code> timestamp field on every table. This means I know exactly when that record was added - it's like a poor-man's audit.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of adding the <code>inserted</code> column to every table, like this:</p>
<pre> CREATE TABLE news (
    name            TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title           TEXT NOT NULL,
    article         TEXT NOT NULL,
    inserted        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 );</pre>
<p>You can try something like this:</p>
<pre> CREATE TABLE base (
    inserted        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 );</pre>
<p>then:</p>
<pre> CREATE TABLE news (
    name            TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title           TEXT NOT NULL,
    article         TEXT NOT NULL,
    LIKE base INCLUDING DEFAULTS
 );</pre>
<p>Of course, in this particular case, you don't save a lot of typing, but imagine if you had a 10, 20 or even hundreds of tables. You get the idea, but don't stop there. Here's another base table I use which also has a column for <code>updated</code>:</p>
<pre> CREATE TABLE base (
    inserted        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated         TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 );</pre>
<p>Obviously, at the moment, this is exactly the same as the <code>inserted</code> column, but you'll see in the next article how this can be used to show the last time this record was updated.
