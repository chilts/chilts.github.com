<p>I'm amazed at the reception Cil is getting so far. Further news now is ...</p>
<p>... <a href="/software/cil.html">Cil</a> has been made a featured project on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub's Homepaage</a> (though you have to be logged out to see it).</p>
<p>I spoke with <a href="http://github.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a> a couple of weeks ago about projects which help drive Git adoption and thought he would be interested in Cil. He told me he'd feature it on the front page of GitHub so thanks very much Tom, that's awesome.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/cil">Ohloh stats on Cil</a> are also looking good and will soon show that the project has already had 6 contributors, some of whom have jumped completely out of left-field.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for helping out so far.
