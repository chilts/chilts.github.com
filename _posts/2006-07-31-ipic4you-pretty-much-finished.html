<p>I said on 11th July that I would be doing a new photo site for my family.
Well I'm mostly done :-)</p>
<p>In <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/photo-site-for-my-family.html">this
article</a> I
mentioned a new site I wanted to develop for my family to upload photos to.
Well, I'm pretty much done.</p>
<p>I've done a backend Perl module, built the pages in Perl/Mason using a
PostgreSQL backend and it is running on Debian. Yup, you know the score.</p>
<p>I downloaded the design from those guys at \[p]{Open Source Web
Design|http://www.oswd.org/} and put the thing together using some scraps of
scripts I've had for a while but mostly new stuff. </p>
<p>There are just one or two tweaks to make, at which point I'll put up the
source code for everyone to play with (it'll be GPL/Perl Artistic License).</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take a look at the site, head over to
<a href="http://photos.chilts.org/">http://photos.chilts.org/</a>. You guys will only
be able to see any photos the users have marked as public (not many so far
and I don't expect there will be) but you get the jist. The main reason for
the site though is for my dispersed family to be able to share photos with
at least some privacy.</p>
<p>Hopefully other people can use it too.</p>
<p>Once I've updated the code, tied up a few loose ends and made some
documentation, I'll be putting a new section onto kapiti.geek.nz under
/software/ and will start putting some of my other projects up too.
