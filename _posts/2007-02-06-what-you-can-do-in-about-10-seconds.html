<p>Travis just made me laugh. What he said pretty much sums up how I feel about Web Development these days.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/forum/introductions/32.html">introduction on KiwiWriter</a> (5th post down), he said that we (the KiwiWriters group): went from &quot;I want to do something with writing&quot; to &quot;let's get a web domain and pick a style&quot; in about ten seconds.</p>
<p>That pretty much sums it all up for me. It tells us that when this group of ours got together, we wanted to make things happen because we all enjoyed it so much.</p>
<p>Additional to that, we also went from an initial idea to an 'actual, functioning and live' website in less than two months.</p>
<p>It just all moves so fast and that's exactly what I like about it.
