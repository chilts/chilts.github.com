<p>I know people were talking about this a few months ago but finally I <a href="http://www.raboplus.co.nz/blog/2009/15Jun09-Spending-recession.aspx?type=tcm36-71888">found some common sense</a>. By a bank of all things.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I saw people interviewed on the TV and they said things like:</p>
<blockquote>I'm spending our way out of the recession</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>Yeah, it [the recession] is not affecting me. I just keep spending</blockquote>
<p>And I would think &quot;wow, these people have no idea&quot;.</p>
<h2>Trying to Change the World One Person at a Time</h2>
<p>Sometimes, changing the world one person at a time can work but pretending that your spending will help us get out of the recession is a bit silly.</p>
<p>The amount of money that you are in control of is such a tiny fraction of what is required, you'd need the whole world to think and act similarly.</p>
<p>Instead, you should be worried about your future, have an <a href="http://www.retire-at-40.com/blog/if-you-lost-your-job-would-you-be-okay.html">emergency fund</a> and be a little more sensible with your money.</p>
<p>Because you never know what's down the road.</p>
