<p>After lately talking to different people about the Amazon Web Services, I have become interested in them again.</p>
<p>And after ages and ages wanting a place 'in the cloud' to store my files, I decided that I'm not going to wait for <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMail_Drive">Google's GDrive</a>, but instead am going to use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon's S3</a>.</p>
<p>So, all those old photos I have dotted around are currently being uploaded. I'm using a program I wrote, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/s3bak/">s3bak</a>, and whilst I haven't touched it much in a year, it's still working fine. It's even got <a href="s3bak-out-now.html">some nice features</a>. Think I'll be hacking a little on that in the next week or so.</p>
<p>Anyway, it'll be more important to me tomorrow when I finally get myself a new digital camera. It's not top of the range but the price/functionality is exactly what I wanted. The <a href="www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_a570is.asp">Canon A570 IS</a> isn't too expensive but has some of those things I like, such as aperture and shutter priority.</p>
<p>I also think things like S3 are underused in some commercial senses. There's certainly one thing I'd love to use it for in work and it would save buying a lot of hardware and save a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>As I said to someone recently, &quot;because it's on the same system Amazon use, if something goes wrong, they would stand to lose a lot more money than you would&quot; - hence, the reliability of the thing is phenomenal. If it's good enough for Amazon, then it's good enough for my backups.</p>
<p>I also intend to use it for various web projects I have brewing too. Not to mention EC2 and the other Amazon Services.
