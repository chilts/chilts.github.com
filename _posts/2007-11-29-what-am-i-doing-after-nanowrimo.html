<p>Just thought I would add a copy of a post I put on the NaNoWriMo forums in response to the question &quot;What are you doing after NaNoWriMo?&quot; Lots of things to do it seems.</p>
<p>I have a number of things I'm going to do after NaNoWriMo, some short term, others a bit longer term.</p>
<p>Short term, I am going to be adding 'Member Excerpts' to <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> with the help of the others in the KW committee (<a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a>, <a href="http://cottreau.blogspot.com/">Travis</a> and <a href="http://vyanae.blogspot.com/">Cassie</a>). We also have many other writing challenges planned throughout the year so check it out when you can (especially if you don't want the excitement of writing to die down once NaNo is over.</p>
<p>There are a few other more personal projects - mainly websites - which are in need of my attention. And I shall certainly be posting more blog entries over the coming weeks. I might even do <a href="http://www.x365.org/">x365</a> this year like <a href="/random/starting-x365-on-my-birthday.html">I said I would last year</a> :-)</p>
<p>Longer term, I have found out that <a href="http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/">ScriptFrenzy</a> will be April next year instead of June which is awesome. That means I can do that in April and still do SoCNoC in June, as well as all the short story weekends planned over the coming year. At the moment, it looks like I'll also be ML (Municipal Liason) for Wellington for ScriptFrenzy too which will be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and I have lots of housework to do. Yay, what fun (NOT). Phew!
