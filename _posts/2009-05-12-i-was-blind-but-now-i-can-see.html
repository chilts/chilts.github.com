<p>I just upgraded from an old Feisty to a shiny new Jaunty. There are lots of updates, lots of shiny new things and it boots like a Ferrari.</p>
<p>But out of all the software that has been upgraded, I think my jump in Git versions from the old 1.4.something I had from Feisty Backports to the new v1.6.0.4 in Jaunty is going to give me the most pleasure.</p>
<p>Already I am seeing better formatted messages, more information and some really nice messages too. Before today, I'd never see the following:</p>
<pre> $ git checkout blah
 Switched to branch &quot;blah&quot;
 Your branch is behind 'origin/blah' by 9 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.</pre>
<p>That's awesome. Now I know, before I start to hack, that I might as well rebase because I'll have to do it before I push anyway.</p>
<p>As I said to a friend earlier on today:</p>
<blockquote>I was blind, but now I can see.</blockquote>
<p>I think that's what the blind guy meant when Jesus healed him ... he'd obviously just upgraded Git!
