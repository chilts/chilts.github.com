<p>It seems details are leaking about Google's new OpenSocial application API.</p>
<p>It also looks like the launch date for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/details-revealed-google-opensocial-to-be-common-apis-for-building-social-apps/">Open Social</a> will be on Thursday which is what was rumoured at the <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/i-cant-believe-i-didnt-see-this-before.html">end of September</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, it doesn't sound like what I was hoping for. I was hoping that there would be Application Services, Data Services and Mashup-Services and that you could do it on your own site anywhere.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the Application Services and the Data Services will be there, but the Mashup Services won't be. This is because the final point above - being able to host your services anywhere - doesn't seem to be allowed.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like the API is for Application Services <strong>to be embedded</strong> into the Data Services' own website. Limiting or what?</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell, I'm a little miffed about that since for me, the big adventure was to open up <em>where</em> you can host your applications/mashups and not just copy Facebook's walled-garden approach and embed <em>all</em> the applications within one site.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/everyone-getting-into-the-sharing-data-space.html">my initial look</a> at <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/blog/2007/10/04/on-board-with-oauth">OAuth</a> will be the thing that now excites me most and I'm going to have to start reading a bit more about it.  I feel that this <em>can</em> be used for what I would like to see in the real Open Social scene ...</p>
<p>... and what is that? ...</p>
<p>... that the <strong>Data</strong> is open (using proper Authentication of course), and not just that the Application API is open.</p>
<p>The fact that an Application API is open really just means it is a standard and nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Things have changed in this day and age. The application doesn't matter anymore because the web <em>is</em> the application. Not one site. Not a few sites, but the <em>whole</em> web.</p>
<p>And while we used to say <strong>Content is King</strong>, in reality these days <strong>Data is King</strong>, or even more specifically <strong>Social Data is King</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, I hope to learn a little more about Google's OpenSocial and I'm almost preying it isn't what I think it is now.
