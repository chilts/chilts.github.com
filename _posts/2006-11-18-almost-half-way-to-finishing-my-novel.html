<p>&quot;The Bright Side of Casey Hill&quot; is almost half way.</p>
<p>On my progress report, it says that I did 2316 words yesterday and so far today (we're only 2hr 17mins into it) I've done 1746. Technically though, it was all done on yesterday's date since I haven't been to sleep yet - that's 4062 in total!</p>
<p>But,.. if I think about it in a different way, it means I got higher than what my projected average was yesterday (by 196 words over 2120) and I'm already within 358 words of today's projected average of 2104.</p>
<p>That's really cool,</p>
<p>I figure I can write 358 words in around 20 minutes, so depending on when I get up - and I think I deserve a lie in - I then have the whole of Saturday to start knocking my projected average down :-)</p>
<p>Basically what that means is, since there are 13 days left, everytime I write 13 words my projected average comes down by one. I'm updating my figure regularly now because it is very exciting to see that figure come down...</p>
<p>...but it's even more exciting that we're heading towards the end of the third week and it's looking very good to finish on target.</p>
<p>P.S. \[p]{Penny|http://she.geek.nz/} passed 25,000 today, so congratulations Penny.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Travis passed another milestone at 35,000 today too, well done to you too.
