<p>Yep, I hit my word tally tonight. A nice 50101 words in total.</p>
<p>I'm still not yet finished on the story, so I might do a few more tomorrow to finish it off.</p>
<p>And for all to see, here's my winner's certificate to prove it:</p>

<p>Happy days.</p>
<p><a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/2007/06/socnoc-winner.html">Kerryn</a> and I were doing 10 minute word wars all night and I was slowly catching up. As it turned out, we decided to do a 15 minute one at the end so we'd both make it before midnight. It was so much fun and we'd been pretty close to each other for at least the past 2 weeks or so.
