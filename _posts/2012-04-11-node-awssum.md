Over on my [author page on NPM](http://search.npmjs.org/#/_author/Andrew%20Chilton) I now have 7 packages available to
download and install. However, the one I've put the most time into is the [AwsSum](http://search.npmjs.org/#/awssum)
package. It is a set of modules to talk to lots of Web Service APIs.
