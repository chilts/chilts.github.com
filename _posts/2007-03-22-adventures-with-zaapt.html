<p>Many things have happened this week. Here's a quick run-down.</p>
<p>Following on from yesterday's article about <em>Dynamic Method Generation</em> I didn't get chance to play with it further tonight.</p>
<p>Instead, I had some outside interest (I can't talk about yet) regarding Zaapt and it's blog capabilities. I'd been putting it off, but I just about got it up and running. The example Zaapt sites <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/blog/">now have a blog</a> (<a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/blog/rss20.xml">plus feed</a>).</p>
<p>In other news, I'm in the middle of a big custom content addition for KiwiWriters so hopefully I'll have that out of the way by next week sometime. It's amazing how you're not busy, then three things come along at once.</p>
<p>It's all happening.
