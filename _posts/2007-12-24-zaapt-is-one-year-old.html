<p>A few days ago, Zaapt became one year old. But the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>It's been a great week for <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> this week. Not only has it passed it's first birthday (born on first check-in) it's also had a lot of development done on it. The  models were improved in Sep/Oct and this month it's been the controller side of things. The views didn't need much change but maybe a minor tweak here or there.</p>
<p>I mentioned the other week that I am now using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/list">issue list</a>  on my Google Code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Project Homepage</a>. At this very moment I can tell you that there are six issues I have to do before I release v0.1 - which will be an amazing achievement. It will also signify the first release which I will be happy for other people to start using - before now it was still in a little flux.</p>
<p>As 2007 finishes up, I look back on the number of hours I've put into Zaapt and see that it's all been worthwhile. I have spent a hell of a lot of hours on it but to now have a CMS written in Perl and using PostgeSQL as it's main store is just great. It was always an ambition of mine to have that combination and Release v0.1 will realise that (note if you Google for <strong>cms</strong>, <strong>perl</strong> and <strong>postgres</strong>, Zaapt is in the top 10 hits and has been since March).</p>
<p>As <a href="http://nigel.mcnie.name/">Nigel</a> a friend of mine said to me recently, &quot;<em>We just shake you and a site falls out</em>&quot; - which just proves how easy it is to create a Zaapt site.</p>
<p>So 2008 will be a belter of a year for Zaapt. I'm aiming to get it into Debian with the help of <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/8413">Francois Marier</a> so after the v0.1 release, I'll sit down with him and figure out what I should do before we put it in - he doesn't know this yet :-)</p>
<p>Finally, just to give you a glimpse of how interesting Zaapt will be next year, here's a quote from one of my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/detail?id=25">current open issues</a>:</p>
<blockquote>This issue also implements an idea I've had for a while in which
models can also be mash-ups of other models. In this case, one model is
referencing another. In another case, who's to say that a model might not
just link together a blog.entry, a gallery.picture and a map.location.</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't that be oarsum - &quot;CMS mash-ups&quot;.
