<p>I have managed a really good 4100 words today.</p>
<p>The competition between me and <a href="http://she.geek.nz/">Penny</a> is getting better and I think it's good since we are definately spurring each other on at the moment. It's always good to have someone running at near enough the same speed.</p>
<p>When this morning came around, I was on 10842 and am now on 14946, so I've have a belter of a day writing. The funniest thing is, on my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/NanowrimoUtils/ProgressReport/135623.html">Progress Report</a>, it has put today's 4104 figure in bold since it considers it an 'outlier' :-)</p>
<p>In their own words, this is a <strong>truly exceptional day</strong> so I will take that as a compliment as well as taking it with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Basically what this means though, is that I'm in a much much better position to actually get to the target before the end of the month. I think I might actually need more than 50,000 words to finish the novel but if I can say I've done the first 50,000 in November then I'll be able to proudly show off my certificate.
