<p>After a short hiatus, caused mostly by the summer, I'm back to hacking Zaapt.</p>
<p>I'd forgotten how much fun it was too. I've done even more tidying up due to <a href="upgraded-kiwiwriters.html">KiwiWriters being upgraded</a> and I've fixed a number of things in both <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> and KW itself.</p>
<p>Once I've done a bit more on KW, I'll probably start on the work for v0.2 of Zaapt. That should be lots of fun too.
