<p>After almost all of October being spent on polishing and shining Zaapt, I'm now making the move to Etch and Apache 2 from Sarge and Apache Perl.</p>
<p>After telling you about my <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/zaapt-unrecognisable-from-two-weeks-ago.html">refactoring on Zaapt</a> I'm now migrating my sites over to Etch with Apache 2.</p>
<p>This site, kapiti.geek.nz, is the first to move. I did it last night and generally it went quite well. I got most of the bugs out last night before I switched DNS so that was good. I did find one this morning however regarding my RSS feeds, so I apologise if you had to wade through a list of broken links to my site from your feed reader this morning (one silly '/' is all that caused it).</p>
<p>Since then, I have found a few other back-end things which needed fixing, mainly caused by the migration from the old roles and privileges to the new RBAC. Overall though, I'm really happy. I may find some more problems when I migrate Zaapt and Zaapt Simple but hopefully all those things will be ironed out by the time I migrate <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>.
