<p>For ages I have ignored the issues tab for Zaapt inside the Google Code site but I decided that I had so many plans and ideas rolling around in my head, that it made sense to get them down.</p>
<p>So tonight I have just entered <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/list">18 issues</a> which I need to work through over the next few months.</p>
<p>Currently there are two bugs, two tasks and the rest are enhancements.</p>
<p>So you can see that I think <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> works pretty well but there are still plenty more things to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code Project Hosting</a> and its issue list is also helping more than just listing the issues. It is also helping me figure out which issues I'm going to fix before I release v0.1 of Zaapt and which ones I can leave until v0.2 (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/list?sort=milestone">milestone ordered list</a>).</p>
<p>This also means that once those ones are done, I know it's time to release. A bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> whereby you know your development is done when all your tests pass (we hope).</p>
<p>P.S. I just found a bug in the issue search so I'll report it to Google once I gether evidence.</p>
<p>P.P.S. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/issues/list?&amp;mode=grid&amp;y=Version&amp;x=Milestone">grid view</a> is awesome. On that page I'm categorising the 'y' axis as <strong>Which version of the software the issue relates to</strong> and the 'x' axis as <strong>The release in which it will be fixed</strong>. That's pretty cool.
