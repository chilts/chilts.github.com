<p>There used to be an advert on the TV in the UK back when advertising tobacco was still allowed. It basically put the subject of the advert into an awkward situation, but smoking that cigar made him forget his worries.</p>
<p>Not that I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_is_a_cigar_called_Hamlet">advertising smoking</a> (since I absolutely revile it, it's a disgusting habit) but there are some things at the moment which <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=X0SbVFxl64A">remind me of the advert</a>.</p>
<p>Well, as you guys know, I recently started back at <a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst</a>. Since then I've been a lot happier there than at my previous place. All in all, there are ups and downs but that's the case in any job. Anyway, for the past while in work I've been grappling with using Oracle. It's been a complete PITA for so many reasons but it really does make me wonder why people still use it.</p>
<p>That aside, I was chatting with a friend at my old work on Jabber the other day. He asked me &quot;Are you happy now?&quot; This was in reference to the fact that I'd told him while I was still working at the old place that &quot;You know, I'm not usually this sad&quot;. Anyway, he remembered and asked me. Of course, I said &quot;Yes, 100%&quot;.</p>
<p>So this reminded me of the advert. Even if I have to grapple with Oracle, even if I'd have done things differently, even if this that and the other, all the chaos that usually goes with a project of any decent size, as soon as I realise I'm where I want to be work-wise, none of the little things matter.</p>
<p>Also, things have been pretty rosey outside of work too. As you know, I've been fairly busy and last weekend was no exception. A housewarming on Friday (hi guys), the <a href="http://nzso.co.nz/events/_/date_2007-07-28">NZSO</a> on Saturday for what was an amazing concert, to see <strong>This is New Zealand</strong> at the film festival on Sunday and Rock'n'Roll on Monday evening - from which I can't get the moves out of my head!</p>
<p>I asked the other week, <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/busy-weekend.html">Can it get any better than this?</a>. Well, it seems it can!
