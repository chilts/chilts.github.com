<p>Once upon a time, I worked on the European Space Agency's Beagle2 probe which was supposed to land on Mars. Well, this isn't a story about that. That would be too sad.</p>
<p>But I do remember telling my brother that for the first few weeks of the project, I was <em>&quot;playing&quot;</em> with the prototype board trying to get it to run some Ada 83 programs. He started laughing at me and I asked why.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;Playing with something that costs millions of pounds - doesn't sound right to me.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>But I explained to him that the only way to learn something is to have a play with it. That's what kids do and sometimes as adults we forget that it's not just one way to learn but the <strong>best</strong> way to learn.</p>
<p>Here's an opportunity to find out what all the fuss is about over the Amazon Web Services, specifically EC2. I have written an article called <a href="/software/getting-started-with-ec2.html">Getting Started with EC2</a> so just go over there and have a play. </p>
<p>And the funny thing is, it's just so easy, it's almost childsplay.
