<p>After reports in the past saying it would be good for the British Government, finally someone is backing it.</p>
<p>See this article: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6430069.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6430069.stm</a></p>
<p>I think this quote is great:</p>
<p><em>&quot;All too often a government IT system is incompatible with other types of software, which stifles competition and hampers innovation&quot;</em>
<br />
<strong>- George Osborne, Shadow Chancellor</strong></p>
<p>I still think smaller governments, like right here in New Zealand, are ripe for converting over to Open Source and can pave the way forward. The British Government is a lot bigger and I fear would wait until it has been proven elsewhere.</p>
<p>Then again, I remember something about one of the South American countries converting. I'll have a Google round to see what I can find.
