<p>On my last laptop, I decided to dual boot the Windows install and Linux. After 2 hours of trying to download stuff, I installed over the whole thing.</p>
<p>On this, my newer laptop, I loaded XP up only to backup the Windows thing onto 7 CDs. I'm not sure why I did that but I decided that was after that rigmarole, I'd had enough. I installed over it within the hour.</p>
<p>This guy decided to take Windows Vista for a spin for 14 days. What a brave man he was. Read this, it's funny: <a href="http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/13114/1090/">Vista: They took five years for this?</a></p>
<p>It only goes to prove to me that I am better off in the world where you have choice and all of it free. Choice of what programs to use and choice of freedom.
