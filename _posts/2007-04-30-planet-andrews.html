<p>So there is a new planet, for Geeky Andrew's in New Zealand.</p>
<p>I didn't create it, <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> did. Not sure why, but I think she snapped under the social pressure that is <a href="http://andrews.planet.geek.nz/">Andrew</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and I like the design too. Simple and very Red.
