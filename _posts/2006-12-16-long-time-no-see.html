<p>After a while away in the wilderness, I'm back!</p>
<p>In the past three weeks I have done a number of things:</p>
<ul><li>finished a novel - NaNoWriMo is not forgotten :-)</li><li>changed jobs</li><li>moved house</li><li>been away for a weekend</li><li>had a lack of webbernet</li><li>started 'Project X' with a \[p]{few} \[p]{other} \[p]{Wellingtonians}</li><li>and lots of other stuff</li></ul>
<p>At the moment I have a shortish timespan where I can update my blog but as I said, I'm still not on the internet at home. Hopefully by next week I'll be
back for real - you have absolutely no idea how hard it is to live without
connectivity.</p>
<p>So my apologies for the flurry of posts. I have a number of pent-up blog posts I need to get out of my system.
