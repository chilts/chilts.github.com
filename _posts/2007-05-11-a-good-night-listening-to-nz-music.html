<p>Tonight I went to see an event run specifically for New Zealand Music month.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wbb.wellington.net.nz/">Perlorus Trust Wellington Brass Band</a> put on a great display of New Zealand music and one of the best things about it was that many of the actual composers were actually there.</p>
<p>An excerpt from their site (before they take it down):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This concert will feature New Zealand works of music by Ken Young, John Rimmer, Nick van Dijk, Aaron Lloydd, Norman Goffin, John Ritchie, Andrew Weir, Ross Harris and Anthony Ritchie several of whom will conduct their own music.</p>
<p>Soloists will be David Bremner (NZSO principal trombone) and David Chaulk (euphonium).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, all in all, it was very enjoyable. You should come along the next time they do something. It's a great tradition for Wellington to have and long may it continue.</p>
<p>I've been along twice now and though I wasn't sure if I was a brass band fan before then, I am now! Looking forward to the next one too.
