<p>After thinking we were too late, we caught a glimpse - it is beautiful.</p>
<p>After reading all those articles yesterday and this morning, I got the impression that the comet was really close to the sun and you'd only be able to see it for a few minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>After heading to the coast and getting some good photos (I'll try and post some) of a really nice sunset, it was time to go. We had arrived just after sunset, but more importantly, there were clouds on the horizon - which is why we thought it had gone.</p>
<p>At around 9:20pm, while it was still quite high in the sky, one of our group spotted it.</p>
<p>It really is quite stunning :-)</p>
<p>Certainly, I'll try and see it again over the next few days and probably weeks. It will get feinter, but by then I hope to have seen it many more times.</p>
<p>This weekend, I'm planning on going out to the Wairarapa where it will be a lot darker (no light polution) and hopefully a flatish landscape around me. Should be fun.</p>
