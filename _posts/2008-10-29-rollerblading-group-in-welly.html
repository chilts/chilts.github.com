<p>Just thought I'd post a link following on from my post the other week about how I enjoyed the roller disco.</p>
<p>It turns out that Wellington has <a href="http://iceskating.meetup.com/37/">Rollerblading group</a> (thanks <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Shiny</a> for the link) though the group is still young, it looks like we can kick-start it with a few more people.</p>
<p>They (me and the group founder at the moment) are having a blade around <a href="http://iceskating.meetup.com/37/calendar/8789461/">Oriental Parade on the 9th November</a> from 2pm, to Evans Bay and then back for coffee and ice cream.</p>
<p>There were a few people who seemed interested after <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/fun-roller-disco.html">my last post</a> about rollerblading so come and join us (weather dependent).</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
<p>P.S. I went out to <a href="http://www.makarapeak.org/">Makara Park</a> on my new mountain bike today - and fell off twice. I now have a number of bruises on my shins but luckily it wasn't major. Still, it's fantastic fun though.
