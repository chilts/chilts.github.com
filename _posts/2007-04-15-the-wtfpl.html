<p>Just found a new type of Public License... :-)</p>
<p>Here it is: <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">The WTFPL</a>.</p>
<p>I would say <em>Caution: Swearing</em> but it's pretty obvious what word it is from the title.</p>
<p>Now, I wonder what I have of mine that I can publish under <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING">The WTFPL</a>.
