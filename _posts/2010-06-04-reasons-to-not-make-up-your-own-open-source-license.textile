If Google can't get their "WebM license":http://webmproject.org/license/ right, then who can:

* "Changes to the WebM Open Source License":http://webmproject.blogspot.com/2010/06/changes-to-webm-open-source-license.html

I did wonder why they didn't just go with "GPLv3":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html but I figured that Google usually like the BSD-style licenses. They have answers on their "Licensing FAQ":http://www.webmproject.org/about/faq/#licensing but still, it makes you wonder.

For example, I wonder if this is essentially the BSD license with the patent clauses from the GPLv3. That would be both interesting and cool, though I'd still prefer GPL over BSD.
