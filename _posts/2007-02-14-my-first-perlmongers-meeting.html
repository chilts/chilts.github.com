<p>For two years I meant to go to PerlMongers, but always convinced myself that I just wanted to go home. I went the other night for the first time, now I wish I'd gone earlier.</p>
<p>We had a <em>Lightening Talks</em> meeting where we had a number of speakers (see <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/index.html">13 Feb</a> and had a good chat afterwards too.</p>
<p>It was also really nice seeing a few of the old faces and hope to see them again...</p>
<p>...in fact, I've signed up to do a talk there next month. I'm not going to tell you the title of the talk since it is still a work in progress, though I will tell you it has to do with Perl/Mason and a few things I learnt implementing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/">Zaapt</a>.
