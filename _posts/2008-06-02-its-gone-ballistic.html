<p>Just the other day, we were talking how ninety-something participants at the start of SoCNoC was good.</p>
<p>Well, less than two days into it we're already onto <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2008.html">123 participants</a> and I'm sure we'll get a few more too. Last year I predicted that we'd get to 120 - double last years total - but I never actually thought we'd do it.</p>
<p>It just seems to have gone ballistic over the last couple of days. I've tried to write but managed only 1,283 words since the start. There have been so many other things to do, it's plain crazy - but then, that's why we all got into in the first place!</p>
<p>Anyway, I should easily be able to pull it back like I've done in the past but at the moment, I'm just enjoying everything about it. Now I wonder if we'll collectively hit two million words. I would find that staggering.</p>
<p>We've certainly received a lot more hits on the site over the past few days too. I reckon there are some companies out there in New Zealand who don't get as many hits in a year as we're going to get in June but I will post the full figures once the month is out.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://nigel.mcnie.name/">Nigel</a> said to me recently, it'll be a good test for <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> too, but in all honesty I reckon it won't push it until we get close to a million or two million hits in the month. Here's hoping!
