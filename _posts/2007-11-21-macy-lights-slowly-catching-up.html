<p>It's 2/3rds of the way through November but I have only just passed the halfway mark.</p>
<p>With only 10 days left and 20 days gone, I still have half the novel to write. It's been a crazy month so far, lots of things happening and work taking far too much time, but I'm determined to finish the novel and get my 50,000 words within November.</p>
<p>Even though my average word count required for the rest of the month is 2,500 words per day, I still reckon I can do it.</p>
<p>I realised that there was only one more weekend left in November but hopefully that won't be too busy (unlike all the other weekends so far).</p>
<p>Still, that didn't stop me from creating an extra artificial one. I'm going to take next Thursday and Friday off work because:</p>
<ul><li>I deserve a break, and</li><li>I <strong>have</strong> to finish <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> </li></ul>
<p>...it just wouldn't be the same if I didn't win.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>As I've said before, I'm just loving <a href="/writing/macy-lights.html">Macy Lights and the Battle for Ashton's Gate</a>   so that's added incentive to finish as if I needed any more.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I decided yesterday that the novel itself could be split into three parts. I have written <strong>Part I</strong> in the first 25k and have hinted at what happens in <strong>Part II</strong>. <strong>Part III</strong> will be written for my second 25k.</p>
<p>This means I shall be delaying writing <strong>Part II</strong> until after November, which will also be about 25k.</p>
<p>This turn completely took me by surprise since my plan had always been to write <strong>Part II</strong> right there inside the novel (not that I knew it was separate part back then).  The only shame is that I had to write a short synopsis right in the middle of the novel instead of writing the whole lot. Ah well, sometimes that's just got to be done during NaNo.</p>
<p>Finally, wish me luck for what will be a mad rush for the rest of November.
