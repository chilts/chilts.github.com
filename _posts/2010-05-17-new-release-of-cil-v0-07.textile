title: New Release of Cil v0.07
published: true
tags: [ cil ]
---
I'd just like to mention that cil v0.07 has had a belated release. It had a bit of work done to it (6 issues) back in January and February and since it's been working fine for me since then, I thought it about time to release.

Please see the "project page for cil":/project/cil/ for the download link and other information.

Note, the six issues that have been completed are (generated by `cil summary --is-closed --label=Milestone-v0.07`:

* 03c93e82 Remove the whole VCS.pm stuff, just have a Git.pm at the top level
* 1111d724 Make sure libfile-homedir-perl is in Debian packaging
* 1a5fb257 Make sure depends-on and precedes can --add and --commit
* 52d702df The StatusOpenList and StatusClosedList should fully describe what is allowed
* c77fae7c Make commit messages nicer when multiple issues are updated
* f7ce705b Check for duplicate DependsOn and Precedes
