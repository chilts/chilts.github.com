<p>So far, we now have 19 people signed up to do SoCNoC on KiwiWriters.org</p>
<p>That's actually quite amazing and we're still only the 10th May! Hopefully by the start of June, we'll have quite a few more.</p>
<p>At first, I thought having 10 people would be fun, so I think that any more than that is excellent! So come on, come and <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/sign-up.html">join us</a>! Don't forget to sign up for <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/my/challenge/site/socnoc-2007.html">SoCNoC</a> too.</p>
<p>I still haven't prepared anything yet so that's something I'm going to have to work on this weekend. Thanks to <a href="http://writingangel.blogspot.com/">Kerryn</a>, she's posted a number of challenges which help with preparation. You'd have to see the forums for full details.</p>
<p>I've also recently added word count widgets to KiwiWriters - making graphics on-the-fly using Perl/Mason, which is always good fun. See my <a href="/">Homepage</a> to see one of them.
