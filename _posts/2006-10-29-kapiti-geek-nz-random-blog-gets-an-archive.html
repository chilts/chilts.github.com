<p>I've just added support for an archive so that past articles are now browsable.</p>
<p>Once an article has dropped off the front page, it really can't be accessed from this site :-( but only from external links to it.</p>
<p>So, a monthly archive is now available from the left menu.</p>
<p>The CMS also has support for yearly and daily archives as well as monthly ones, in fact, you can put any date and time interval you like (so long as Postgres likes it). Of course, it is restrained by the front end rather than the back-end, so you can't just go making up dates.</p>
<p>As an example, for October, you'd use <a href="2006-10.html">2006-10.html</a> and for today you can use <a href="2006-10-29.html">2006-10-29.html</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy.
