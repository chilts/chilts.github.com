<p>I've wondered for quite a long time, but where is the best place in NZ to get good and reasonably priced CDs?</p>
<p>I'm almost bored to tears going into the following shops:</p>
<ul><li>The Warehouse - just stocks chart music</li><li>The CD Store - since they're always overpriced</li><li>Whitcoulls - not much selection</li></ul>
<p>I should go to:</p>
<ul><li>Real Groovey - pretty good for 2nd hand but sometimes still more expensive than new in other shops</li></ul>
<p>What I really need is an online retailer where I can browse from the comfort of my office chair, oh, er, I mean armchair and receive them in a day or so in the comfort of my house.</p>
<p>What do you recommend? Take into account that I need to be buying and supporting NZ music more than I do now but also that I won't be exclusively buying Kiwi made.
