<p>I seem to read a lot about Linux. But I also read a lot about free software and freedoms in general. It seems today has lots of interesting news about the latter.</p>
<p>I've given up reading <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/">http://www.linuxtoday.com/</a> because of all the adverts and the fact that you have to click firstly to get a brief of the story, then the story itself. Instead, I just read <a href="http://lxer.com/">http://lxer.com/</a> since they all pretty much list the same things anyway.</p>
<p>So, here are the articles I found interesting today:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://wolfgang.lonien.de/?p=394">Why Proprietary Code is Bad for Security</a> (which I think should also read &quot;Why Proprietary Code is Bad for your Privacy&quot;</li><li><a href="http://thetuxproject.com/freedomwaretake2">Freedomware free as in $$</a></li><li><a href="http://linux-watch.com/news/NS5294337662.html">Microsoft kills off anti-Linux 'Get the Facts' site</a></li><li><a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/08/24/birdsong-a-requiem-for-drm/">Bird Song: A requiem for DRM</a></li></ul>
<p>I find these stories interesting for various reasons. I've spoken to friends about Skype and I'm <strong>still</strong> resisting using it, though the pull is string.</p>
<p>The second article because I just think it's funny - &quot;Why is all this high quality software free?&quot; they say. You say &quot;Because it's priceless!&quot; :-)</p>
<p>I'm still in two minds about what Microsoft is doing flirting with free software but until they do the right thing in <strong>every</strong> area (not just one or two), then I won't trust them until that point.</p>
<p>And finally, about the complete mess with DRM. People recorded LP's and tapes off each other. They copied 'protected' games off each other with the C64, Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga (the list goes one). They copy CDs, now MP3s, they've hacked the DVD CSS and they will any DRM format you put in front of them. I think companies are learning that people power is important and always wins. Therefore, go with the flow, chill-out and turn it to your advantage. Give the people what <strong>they</strong> want (not what you want to give them) and just watch, you'll make a killing.</p>
<p>So yeah, today's news was quite interesting for free software and freedoms in general.
