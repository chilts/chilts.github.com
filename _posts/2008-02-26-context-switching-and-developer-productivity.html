<p>We all know that when a developer gets interrupted from whatever he's doing, it wipes out a large amount of time, concentration levels and ultimately productivity.</p>
<p>Even ignoring what some <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">really clever people</a> say, sometimes you just <em>know</em> you're not as productive as you should be. Why? Because by the end of the day you think you yourself <em>&quot;Wow, I did nothing today&quot;</em>. That's not always true, you've definitely done <em>something</em> but it just <em>feels like</em> you've done nothing.</p>
<p>So why is that whole lotta nothing feeling cropping up? Well let's look at three typical days at the office.</p>
<p>Every day starts out the same. You wake up, you go to work and just before you go through the main doors you think to yourself &quot;<em>Today, I'm going to finish that task off that has been bugging me for a while</em>&quot;. It's the same every morning and the only variable is that task - it changes every so often.</p>
<p>Then you get three typical types of day.</p>
<h2>The Highly Productive Day</h2>
<p>A highly productive day is when you just hit the right notes the whole day. By hometime your forearms ache a little because you've been furiously writing tests, completing code, checking stuff in and deploying to the staging environment. You've been in your own little world, your concentration levels were amazing and everything just worked. Awesome. Time for a beer.</p>
<h2>The Highly Frustrating Day</h2>
<p>A highly frustrating day is when you've been busy all day, you've managed to get a lot done but there were a few things which just didn't work out. For whatever reason, that library you wanted to use didn't work as you thought, that weird bug in the browser killed too much time for your liking and finally you realised that what you <em>had</em> been developing was slightly wrong and you had to go back and change a few things. Days like this happen all the time, it's not your fault, you know it could have turned out differently but you have also learned a few things and tomorrow is going to be great. A little frustrating but you move on. Time for a beer.</p>
<h2>The Highly Interruptive Day</h2>
<p>Then there is the highly interruptive day. That task you have been working on didn't get more than 12.5 minutes attention per sitting. Something went wrong with the system which you had to fix up. The phone rang on numerous occasions. You had to quote for new work. People kept on coming up to ask for help. Finally to top it all off, that 12.5 minutes you <em>did</em> get to spend on your task didn't really work because your brain was so frazzled you literally figured out where your cursor was in the editor and then wondered what the hell you were editing in the first place anyway. You decide to go home instead of staying late because you just feel tired. Now it's definitely time for a beer.</p>
<p>So the main question about each of these three days is, which can you improve on? Obviously the <strong>Highly Productive Day</strong> was a good one. There's always room for improvement but hell, you felt awesome today. Things just worked out and you had loads of time to spend on that task. Also, during the <strong>Highly Frustrating Day</strong> you had lots of time to spend on the task but in all honesty these things just happen and you move on. Most days are somewhere between these two extremes.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with the <strong>Highly Interruptive Day</strong>. You fixed a couple of things, checked in some code but in all honesty you realise that that task you've had at the top of your list for weeks is still in exactly the same position it was in this morning. Granted, you moved a few lines of code around, you added a test and you even fixed some stuff but mostly you're exactly where you were before. The interuptions just kept on coming. Before you had finished dealing with one of them, the next interuption would turn up. Context switching when interupted takes lots of time anyway but context switching between interuptions - well, that makes for one unhappy programmer. Nothing seems to get done.</p>
<p>And after all that, you have no idea whether today should have been a <strong>Highly Productive</strong> or a <strong>Highly Frustrating</strong> day. You've done so little work you couldn't even gauge how it went. You can justify things by saying &quot;<em>Well, I'm basically a consultant now anyways</em>&quot; but really, you're expected to be a programmer, producing excellent code in what little time you actually have to develop.</p>
<p>So there lies the problem with the <strong>Highly Interruptive Days</strong>. In both of the previous cases you managed to do things, learn from things and improve things. But in this final case, you managed nothing.</p>
<p>Something funny then happens. As you're going home, you start switching off from work and start thinking about that other project you've got on the go. That one you have at home where you've been playing with new technologies, creating free software or just learning for the sake of it. Just to prove something to yourself, you realise that in the two hours you've spent hacking away with just an ambient bit of music in the background, you've produced more high quality code that you will in the rest of the week. No-one phoned up, no-one sent you email, or IM messages or came knocking on the door. You spent a solid two hours developing code, you were in the zone and it's actually still before midnight.</p>
<p>It's almost depressing to know that it still can be done if it wasn't for all those other inputs switching you out of context and just plainly getting in the way. And the worst thing is, you know tomorrow is going to be exactly the same.
