<p>And I still don't know what I'm writing!</p>
<p>November is upon me and after thinking (or indeed not thinking) about <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> for the past 3 months, it's finally time to actually do something about it. Initial thanks for getting me into this mess goes to <a href="http://www.coffee.geek.nz">Brenda</a> (are you doing it, eh?), though I have managed to rope someone else into doing it too (hi Travis).</p>
<p>So far I have decided what the main character's name is - if you must know, it is '<em>Casey Hill</em>'. Even though I have gone through many changes about the type of novella I wanted to write, I've ended up making it a Science Fiction, though I think (or is that hope) it will be part comedy too. The reason I have ended up in this combination is so that I can make things up, don't have to do much research, and possibly get away with it :-) but not likely.</p>
<p>Apart from those two minor facts, I really don't know what else I'm going to put in it. The main (indeed essential) plan is to write 50,000 words in November and be able to say I've done it. Editing, tearing up of manuscript and open fires made of paper can come later.</p>
<p>Here are some other ideas I've had but whether any of them get into the novel will be decided on the throw of a dice:</p>
<ul><li>something to do with genes and nanotechnology</li><li>something about aliens, or extra-terrestrials, or space-people who don't look like humans</li><li>space-people who <strong>do</strong> look like humans</li><li>a love story of some sort, preferably one where the hero or heroin almost get killed - maybe together at the same time (hey, I can see it happening now - opening scene!)</li><li>a completely weird magical 'force' which certain people have but isn't actually called 'The Force' since I think that's been done before</li></ul>
<p>And just to complete the list of things I might do, here's a list of things I should do, but probably won't since I'm not a novel writer, don't know what I'm doing, have no-idea why I'm doing it and will have no time for anything else:</p>
<ul><li>cook</li><li>clean</li><li>wash</li><li>eat</li><li>sleep</li><li>things that are TMI</li></ul>
<p>(remind me, why <em>am</em> I doing this again)</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I start. Let's go.
