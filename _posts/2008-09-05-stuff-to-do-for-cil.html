<p>Whilst I was away, there were a number of things cropping up that people wanted for Cil.</p>
<p>The two most interesting requests that people have submitted are:</p>
<ul><li>addition of UserName and UserEmail to the <code>.cil</code> config file</li><li>ability to have a <code>cil work</code> command</li></ul>
<p>The 2nd idea strikes me as being <strong>really</strong> useful so thanks to <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog">Yanick</a> for all of his ideas, keep them coming.</p>
<p>Both of the ideas above are good but there are just a few things I'll want to discuss with the authors. There were also some requests that I create a mailing list for Cil development - now done - so we can talk these things through.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cil-dev">Cil Development</a></li></ul>
<p>Please join up if you are interested in Cil and where this little adventure might take us.</p>
<p>Finally, a big hello to everyone ... I'm back in the country so I'll see you all very soon.
