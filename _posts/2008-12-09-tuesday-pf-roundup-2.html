<p>
This week's roundup comes on the back of some pretty exciting facts and figures for '<span style="font-style:italic;">Retire at 40</span>'. The main one is that I passed 100 subscribers. This actually happened to be one of my goals when I started this blog and I wanted to achieve it in less than 3 months - I'll be three months on Thursday, so that's good.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, on to the roundup.

<p>
This is a classic article and one which a lot of PF bloggers have in their arsenal. Spending all that money on on lunch and not brown bagging it adds up to a fair amount each year, not because lunch is so expensive but because there are so many opportunities to spend money - 5 days a week in fact (usually). This also means there is plenty of opportunity to save money too.

It's almost sad to say but I think many of us actually like doing this and in all honesty it's not about the numbers. I have had many chats with my friends over the past few months and the single overriding thing I take from any conversation I have with people wanting to sort out their finances is this:
</p>

<blockquote>Great, that'll be another person who I can hang out with when we all retire early!</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, it's about being able to help someone else and talk about a subject close to my heart but in all honesty it's about them being able to also do the same as I am. There will be lots of time to hang out and <a href="two-ways-biking-substantially-improves.html">go biking</a> in a few years time.

<p>
Sometimes you think you're mostly there with passive income but many times you still have to do something. He's right in that, you just must not have to do anything at all. I spoke about this in a previous post about <a href="what-is-passive-income-and-why-you-need.html">Passive Income</a> where I said that you must take <span style="font-weight:bold;">you</span> out of any equation for making money, that way, the sky is the limit.

</p>

<p>
This definitely seems like a good thing, not having to go through those stale and boring reviews each and every year. In fact, the reason why I like them most is not to get a pay-rise (though that helps) but to hear and make sure I am doing what is expected of me.

<span style="font-style:italic;">Trent at <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/">The Simple Dollar</a> talked about <a href"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/12/07/the-best-moment-of-your-day/">The Best Moment of your Day</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>
I have always found that writing a journal (a private one, not a web-based one) helps sort through your thoughts for the day. I also found that it could sometimes take a fair amount of time (each day becoming longer and more detailed). Instead, just write about the best moment of your day - that way you also have less to read when you pick it up in a few years!
