<p>After adding trackback to my blog code, I haven't yet enabled it. And I still need to add some trackback code to the admin side...</p>
<p>...tsk tsk.</p>
<p>I really need to get to it, though it has been a mad week or so back in New Zealand. This weekend, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, and the other thing I need to do is add an archive for my blog...bugger. I really shouldn't think about these things 'coz otherwise I'll just find more and more things that need to be done.
