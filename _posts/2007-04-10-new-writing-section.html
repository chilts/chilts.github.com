<p>You know, I'm not really a writer, but I do enjoy doing it - that's all that matters right. And the fun of reading it too.</p>
<p>In honour of fun and nothing more (and nothing less), I present a new <a href="/writing/">writing</a> section on this site. In all honestly, I don't expect much in the way of <em>hey, that was great, you should be an author</em> but more in the way of <em>haha, you're such a fool, that was only just slightly funny, but thanks anyway</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, to kick off the new section, I have added <a href="/writing/the-time-riders.html">The Time Riders</a> which is a <em>Choose your own Adventure</em>. It's only very small and won't take long to read so please, let me know if you enjoyed it (but please read the intro first so you know under what conditions it was written under - see there, that was my excuse).</p>
<p>Finally, the best part about it though is that all writing that appears on this website under the writing section, will be licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</a>. See the <a href="/writing/">writing index</a> page for more details.</p>
<p>Just as a thought, if you read a <em>Choose your own Adventure</em> and then under the ShareAlike part of the license, then you'd be doing a <em>Make your own Adventure</em>.</p>
<p>But what if you did that to more than one story...</p>
<p>...<em>Mashup your own Adventure</em> :-)
