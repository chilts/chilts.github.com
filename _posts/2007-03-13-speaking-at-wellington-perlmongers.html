<p>Tonight, I spoke at Wellington Perlmongers. I volunteered to do it last month and guess what, I only started my slides last night!</p>
<p>I did finish them before 3am though, so I got at least a few hours sleep.</p>
<p>All in all, I thought it went well. I meant it to last for maybe half an hour, but I suspect it was more like 45 mins if not a bit more.</p>
<p>My presentation was in two halves: the first was an introduction to Perl/Mason since I don't think the Wellington Perlmongers had had one before, so I had to go over a lot of material. In fact, I hardly touched the surface of Mason at all and I realised that it is a huge subject to tackle.</p>
<p>This was all in preparation of the main part of the talk. It was titled: '<em>Using Multiple Mason Component Roots: An experiment in CMS Design</em>'.</p>
<p>Basically (ignoring the grand title) it was about writing and using <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> using all the technologies and methodologies mentioned in the titles. I told them about <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> and also about the two demo Zaapt Sites.</p>
<p>All in all, I think my presentation was okay but possibly a bit boring in the middle. It seems that more than just a few people already knew Mason (in fact, probably the majority) but there was certainly a percentage who didn't.</p>
<p>There wasn't many questions about Mason though I learnt a couple of things too. There was, however, quite a number of questions about Zaapt, especially when I started showing them the sites.</p>
<p>One good thing though was that, I now have a copy of <em>Advanced Perl Programming</em> (signed by Simon Cozens) which I was given in return for the presentation. I also have a borrowed copy of <em>Perl 6 Now (Apress)</em> which I shall have a read of and try and write a review for.</p>
<p>I'll throw up a link to the slides once I have them. I reckon they'll appear somewhere on <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/index.html">Wellington Perl Mongers Archive</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: 2007-03-14 10:59:54 - The <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200703/html_mason/index.html">slides</a> are now up. I'll see if I can try to fix the blatent mistakes I made :-)
