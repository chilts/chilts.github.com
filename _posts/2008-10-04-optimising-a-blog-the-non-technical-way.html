<p>This is a technical blog but I'm not talking technical for a moment. I'm talking content and other things around running a site. It's something I have never really done but over the past couple of weeks, is something I've been enjoying a lot.</p>
<p>Granted, when we see a problem, we generally see a technical solution to it, but I want to look at this from a different angle for a moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at my new blog, <a href="/retire-at-40/">Retire at 40</a>. Yes, I know the subject matter is a bit out there but consider the layout for the moment and not yet the content. Also consider some of the other things I have been doing to try and get it off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Layout and General Stuff</strong></p>
<p>Here's a list of some of the tweaks and other things I have been doing in the last two weeks. Generally I change just a bit at a time and hopefully so that it'll help capture more people, more subscribers and with less clutter.</p>
<ul><li>using <a href="http://feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a> for my feed so I can see my subscribers</li><li>added Email Subscribers to the mix</li><li>moved the RSS and Email subscribe information to the top of the page</li><li>also put them at the bottom of each (individual) post</li><li>using Google Analytics to see my hits (currently almost 600 hits in just 21 days :-)</li><li>getting myself 'out there' by posting a guest entry on another Personal Finance blogger, SingleGuyMoney - <a href="http://www.singleguymoney.com/2008/09/being-green-and-how-it-saves-you-money.html">Being Green and how it Saves you Money</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>Now onto the content (but not the subject matter). Here, I have been reading a few other blogs to help in this department. Some of the things I have been trying to do are:</p>
<ul><li>use a Creative Commons picture on every post</li><li>outlining my post before I write it</li><li>putting subheaders into the post, such that it is easier to manage and read - that storyline feel to it keeps readers interested</li><li>writing as though I'm talking <strong>to you</strong> not as though I am writing <strong>about me</strong> (Note: this blog <strong>is</strong> about me, so that's why I do it here.)</li></ul>
<p>I have also been reading a number of blogs about writing copy such that I can increase my skill in this area too. Of course, you can read all you like but it's all about actually doing it. Again, this new blog gives me an outlet to practice and hone my writing skills.</p>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>These are some things I plan to do over time when it makes more sense:</p>
<ul><li>remove the archive completely since no-one really uses it (do you?)</li><li>properly categorise all my posts into a converging set of tags, and show that instead</li><li>put the 'Digg This' button back on each post when I get more subscribers</li><li>promote myself more, either as a guest on other blogs, getting guests onto mine or (as is traditional) commenting on other peoples</li><li>keep reading about Personal Finance, writing in general and - since I can't leave this out - technical bits and pieces to help put all this in place</li><li>start learning more about adverts, affiliate schemes and even direct sponsorships</li></ul>
<p>Oh, and by the way, I'm really enjoying using someone else's hosting service for my blog. I'm sure a few of you wonder why I'm using Blogger instead of my own CMS, but yes, this is also an experiment too (did you notice I separated my <a href="http://andychilton.googlepages.com/retire-at-40.css">stylesheet out onto GooglePages</a> so it didn't have to be included in every page from Blogger - something I still consider a deficiency in the Blogger service).</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<p>So far, I am happy with what I have done and with what I have been learning. It turns out (as always) there is more to it than is initially apparent. As things start happening, I'll keep you posted about how it's going and what other changes I shall be making due to what I have been learning elsewhere.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're interested in the whole Personal Finance field (like myself and <a href="http://frugalme.wordpress.com/">Stephen</a>) are, come talk to us since I find it all very interesting. As with all the other subjects I have touched on today, there is plenty more to learn.
