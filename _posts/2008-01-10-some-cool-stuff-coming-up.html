<p>There are a few things in February I'm really looking forward to.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks like <a href="http://www.mclean.net.nz/">Grant</a> has snared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway">Damian Conway</a> to come and speak to us at <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington.pm</a> . That is going to one awesome evenings.</p>
<p>And secondly something which made me smile. I read the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/">Amazon Web Services blog</a> and saw this article about <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/01/new-zealand-and.html">New Zealand and Australia</a> the other day. So I followed their wiki entry to this page about <a href="http://evangelists.wetpaint.com/page/Mike+Culver+NZ+Australia+Feb+2008">Mike Culver's Schedule</a> only to realise that he's already coming to <a href="http://wellylug.org.nz/">WellyLug</a>/<a href="http://catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst</a> :-) It seems that <a href="s3-revival.html#comments">Brenda</a> was to blame for this - so thanks <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Brenda, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reedwade/2179082035/">Reed</a> and co. have been busy figuring out which language to use next (and it even got posted on <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/01/which-language-to-inflict-on-clients.html">PerlBuzz</a>). I'd have also said <strong>Ada is Anal</strong> but then, I had to do Ada 83 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenscar_profile">Ravenscar Profile</a>) for 9 months once.
