<p>It's been a bit of a crazy week, lots of things happening and not much time to do much.</p>
<p>Luckily it started off well and ended well but the less said about the middle the better.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I went to the first ever performance of Schola Sinfonica (a member of the Wellington Youth Orchestra group of orchestras) for which my friend <a href="http://sounz.org.nz/contributor/performer/1679">Rachel Hyde</a> helped set up and conduct. It was a moving performance especially since it was their first and for which a number of the children were playing either completely new instruments or had only been with them for a few weeks. Overall, their parents must have been very proud and I hope to hear them again soon.</p>
<p>The elder orchestra played afterwards and it seems that Wellington will be blessed with a number of great violinists in the coming years (eight of them performed solos). This was a pretty impressive performance by a good solid set of young people and bodes well for our classical future.</p>
<p>Work this week was pretty mad. There were a few panic buttons pushed and those situations are never that enjoyable but we got through them. I also worked late three evenings so by the time I got home, I didn't want to do much else than eat and go to bed (so my normal life seems to have been put on hold momentarily). However, I felt I was quite productive and so I know we're a good step further along the project line.</p>
<p>The week ended with me going to another classical performance but this time to the <a href="http://nzso.co.nz/concerts/concerts_and_tours/maria_kliegel">NZSO</a>. It was the last subscription concert of the year and a very enjoyable one. I always seem to enjoy about 60% of the music, think that 20% is good but not as exciting as it could be and the remaining 20% is a little weird or not my type. But overall, it's a great experience and I appreciate the fact that I am able to attend these events.</p>
<p>This weekend is already looking decidedly busy. <a href="http://www.makarapeak.org/">Mountain biking</a> tomorrow, some other bits and pieces and I hope to be able to relax tomorrow night. Sunday I will head to the market, have a small ride, meet up with the Wellington <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> contingent at lunch, play indoor soccer in the afternoon and then watch the <a href="http://wellingtonphoenix.com/">Phoenix</a> play early evening. Phew! It's gonna be busy. Not sure when I'll get the time to just chill out.
