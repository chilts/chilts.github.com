<p>As stated in the description to this blog:</p>

<blockquote>My plan is to retire at 40. That doesn't mean to stop working, it means to stop working for other people. I want to financially secure so I can do whatever it is that interests me ... which of course may still be to try and earn a decent amount of money at the same time! At least I'll be enjoying whatever it is I choose to do :-) This blog is about my journey towards that goal. Wish me luck!</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to the above description this in the first item since I expect it will change over time and this helps remember what this blog is all about. Not only that but it will keep reminding me why I'm doing what I'm doing ... saving money, being frugal though still enjoying myself ... since in the future I hope to be doing a lot more of that.</p>

<p>This blog also lets other people know what I'm doing, not because they're interested in <strong>me</strong> but because they're interested in doing the same thing themselves. I mean, who <em>wouldn't</em> want to retire at 40?</p>

<p>Finally, let me just define what I mean by retire since it's probably not what a lot of people think. My plan is to be able to quit my day job by the time I'm 40 and go and do my own thing. I won't be able to live on my savings since it won't be enough but I want to be in a good finacial position whereby I don't need as much income. Whatever I do (future postings to define some possibilites) it'll be a hobby of some sort and something that I entirely enjoy. Also I'll be my own boss which will make a big difference.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy taking this journey with me and maybe you can let me know how you're getting on too.</p>
