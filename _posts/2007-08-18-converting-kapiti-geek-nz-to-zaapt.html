<p>Over the past couple of nights I have redesigned my site and currently have a staging version of it all set up and ready to go.</p>
<p>The main reason for re-doing the site was so that I could convert it into a <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> site. As stated before, currently this is running using some software called <em>Slym</em> which was a precursor to Zaapt. Also, the old modules are no longer maintained and were starting to get on my nerves - anyone notice my blog's archive dates don't keep up? :-(</p>
<p>All in all, the redesign hasn't taken very long at all. In fact, getting a site up and going with Zaapt is just getting quicker and quicker. Recently, I checked in some code into the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt-demo">Zaapt Demo</a> project which creates a basic (and Debianised) site upon which you can add things. To get that up and going takes about 3 minutes from start to finish - customisations after that take longer of course.</p>
<p>So the conversion from this site to the new one took something under six hours! That includes about 3 hrs of setting the site up, templating the HTML and some quick testing and about 3 hrs for the data migration script for everything in the old database. Currently, I'm copying and converting three lots of content sections, one blog and lots of comments and labels.</p>
<p>So all in all, I think getting the site going in less than 6 hours (including a data migration) is quite impressive. Also, when I got the <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> and the <a href="http://simple.zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt Simple</a> websites going <a href="http://kapiti.geek.nz/random/zaapt-now-has-a-life-of-its-own.html">way back in March</a> it only really took me three days to get those going - and they've hardly been changed since.</p>
<p>Also this week, <a href="http://gamma.net.nz/">Don</a> has stated that he <a href="http://www.gamma.net.nz/?p=361">may also switch to Zaapt</a> so that makes me very happy. Finally, Zaapt will be used by someone else. It's not that I'm pressuring him :-) but that would be <strong>oarsum</strong> when it happens.</p>
<p>It does mean however, that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaapt/source">Zaapt sourcecode</a> will now be under scrutiny from my peers. This is a really good thing (I'll know if I'm on the right track) but may also be embarassing (for those times when I've been slack or silly), but hey, that's what free and open source software is about :-) Just having someone else use it will be great...</p>
<p>...and nothing makes me happier.</p>
<p>P.S. the new design will be launched on Sunday just so I can add some spit and polish tomorrow
