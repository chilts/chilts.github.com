<p>I know I've been away for a short while, but here's a quick update.</p>
<p>I am participating in the Easter Challenge on <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a>. It says to write a 6,000 word short story over the long weekend. I have a slightly different plan which will entail 7,500 words. More next week. Oh wait, here's my participation icon:</p>

<p>I've been watching the first season of Scrubs. Dr Cox is Oarsum and Elliott is just, like, amazing (and then I found out that she was the 2nd Becky in Roseanne and I liked her even more)!</p>
<p>Also watched <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> this week too. Funniest film I've seen in a long time.</p>
<p>This blog (or parts thereof) is now being syndicated on <a href="http://planet.geek.nz/">http://planet.geek.nz/</a> and <a href="http://planet.nztech.org/">http://planet.nztech.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there will be some big news over at KiwiWriters today (can't mention it yet)...so look out!
