<p>Last year's inaugural SoCNoC was an astounding success. None of us believed we'd made so many people write so much.</p>
<p>Here are the vital stats from last year:</p>
<ul><li>60 people signed up</li><li>36 people wrote <em>something</em></li><li>16 finished (reached 50,000)</li><li>almost 1,000,000 cumulative words were written</li><li>many hours of fun were had socialising during it - writing isn't a lone sport anymore</li></ul>
<p>This year we've been aiming at doubling it and getting to 2 million words. At first, I wasn't sure but here's a blog entry I found for this time last year:</p>

<p>By the 10th May last year we had 19 people signed up. This year we already have 44. That's over twice as many so let's hope it pushes on like this all the way through to the end of June.</p>
<p>I've said before that it's amazing how just a small group of friends and <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters.org</a> <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/staff.html">organisers</a> can influence such a great number of people to try something new and different. Not only that, but it's a whole lot of fun to do too - in between all the hard work of course!</p>
<p>It definitely pays off though. We might not be the biggest writing site in New Zealand [citation needed] but we're certainly the most exiting [weasel words] :-)
