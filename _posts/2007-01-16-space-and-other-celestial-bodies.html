<p>That last entry reminded me about a naming convention I have.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I bought a laptop computer. It was a Toshiba Satellite and I must admit, it has been like an old friend for a number of years. I called that computer <em>Satellite</em>.</p>
<p>When I got my next one, I called it <em>Comet</em>, even though the model name of the laptop wasn't anything to do with space. My next computer has the name <em>Asteroid</em>. At one stage, I also owned a server called <em>Meteor</em>.</p>
<p>Now that I've kinda used up those names, I started a new naming convention for my new computer. I found a list of \[p]{Jupiter's moons|http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&amp;Display=Moons} and started at number one. This new computer is called <em>Metis</em>. I don't think I'll ever get up to 63 however, though the naming goes a bit funny from 41 onwards.</p>
<p>The other convention I have is for servers, but again that is so far still at number one. The convention for my servers is \[p]{Liverpool FC|http://liverpoolfc.tv/} players and ex-players. My first server didn't have a name, but my current one is called <em>Fowler</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future when <acronym title="Virtual Private Servers">VPS</acronym> or Dedicated Servers are a lot cheaper, I'll be able to get a whole solar system or football team!
