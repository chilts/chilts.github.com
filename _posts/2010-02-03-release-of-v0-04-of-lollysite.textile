Wow, I didn't mention that Lollysite v0.04 was released on the 7th January 2010. So again, it's alpha software but if you really want to use it, use the "Lollysite Git repo":http://gitorious.org/lollysite/ and go from there. Seriously, it has lots of features and bug fixes since then.

See the "releases":/project/lollysite/releases.html page for more info.

At the moment, I have too many things in v0.05 to do, so I'm going to trim it down to a more respectable level. But either way, hope to see you soon for v0.05 :)
