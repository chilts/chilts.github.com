<p>...and having a fun time too!</p>
<p>I said to Brenda the other week that I'd come along to her
<a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/2007/10/12/hackfest_starts.html">Drupal Hackfest</a>, but said I'd probably be hacking on <a href="http://zaapt.org.nz/">Zaapt</a> - which I am.</p>
<p>So far, I have refactored the Account model so it's a lot nicer and uses a lot of the newer functionality contained within Zaapt.</p>
<p>Now, and this is the big one, I'm going to hack in a better Accounts/Roles/Permissions. My original implementation wasn't far from wrong but I've decided it's time to make it right.</p>
<p>Once that's done, plus a few other fixes here and there and I will decide if it's time to finally release v0.1 of Zaapt.</p>
<p>Ah, happy days.
