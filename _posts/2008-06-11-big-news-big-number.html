<p>Today at around 12:45 the cumulative total words written in this years SoCNoC passed the one million mark.</p>
<p>Let me say that again, we passed the <strong>ONE MILLION</strong> words mark. That's just fantastic news and congratulations to all those taking part.</p>
<p>Take a look on the <a href="http://kiwiwriters.org/">KiwiWriters</a> homepage to see for yourself.</p>
<p>Whilst last year we managed almost a million in the month, we've sailed past it after 10.5 days. Plenty of time to hit two million though I know the word rate will slow down somewhat.</p>
<p>Oh, and I still haven't added my 50,000 words. In fact, I still haven't written them ... but you know, that's only a small problem.</p>
<p>20 days left for me to catch up :-)
