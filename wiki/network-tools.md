* nload - A realtime console network usage monitor
* nettop - View hosts/ports taking up the most network traffic
* dstat - Versatile resource statistics tool
* nethogs - Net top tool grouping bandwidth per process
* iftop - displays bandwidth usage information on an network interface

Descriptions are from the first line of the Debian package description.
